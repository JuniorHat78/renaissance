## III. POWER

Every complex system casts a shadow.

This is not a metaphor, or not only a metaphor. It is an observation about the way that human institutions organize themselves, and it is an observation that the English language has already made, repeatedly, independently, across domains that have nothing to do with each other. When we needed a word for the financial system that operates alongside the regulated one but outside its rules, we called it shadow banking. When we needed a word for the parallel government that the opposition party maintains as a mirror of the ruling cabinet, we called it the shadow cabinet. When we needed a word for the economic activity that occurs outside the reach of taxation and regulation, we called it the shadow economy. When we needed a word for the diplomatic negotiations that happen before the official negotiations begin, we called them shadow talks, back channels, the shadow process.

Nobody coordinated this. Nobody sat in a room and decided that "shadow" was the correct term for the hidden system that runs alongside the visible one. The word was reached for independently, in different decades, by different people, in different fields, to describe what they recognized as the same structural phenomenon. And the word they reached for was not "hidden" and not "secret" and not "underground" and not "unofficial." It was shadow. Every time.

This is because shadow is precise in a way that those other words are not. A shadow has a specific geometric relationship to the thing that casts it. It is not independent. It is not unrelated. It is produced by the thing it shadows. It follows the thing's shape. It is connected to the thing at the base. You cannot have a shadow without a source. You cannot have shadow banking without banking. You cannot have a shadow cabinet without a cabinet. The shadow is structurally dependent on the system while being functionally independent of it. Attached and separate. Obedient and autonomous. Following the shape and doing its own thing.

No other word captures this. "Hidden" implies deliberate concealment, and the shadow system is not always deliberately concealed. Sometimes it is simply unlit. "Secret" implies intent, a decision to keep something from view, and the shadow system is often not secret so much as unexamined. "Underground" implies burial, and the shadow system is often operating in plain sight, visible to anyone who thinks to look, ignored not because it is concealed but because the light is on the other thing, the official thing, the thing with the name and the website and the regulatory framework, and the shadow is just the shadow, just the dark shape beside the lit shape, just the thing you step over on your way to the thing you came to see.

---

Here is how the shadow financial system works. Not in theory. Not in the abstract language of economics papers. In practice, in the specific mechanical detail of how risk moves from the lit side to the dark side, through instruments that most people have never heard of and that govern, in a direct and measurable way, the stability of the system that holds their savings and their pensions and their mortgages.

Start with a bank. A regulated bank, the kind with a charter and a building and a sign out front and a relationship with a regulator that requires it to hold a certain amount of capital against the loans it makes. Capital requirements are the foundation of banking regulation. The principle is simple: if you lend money, some of that money will not come back, because some borrowers will default, and when they default the bank absorbs the loss, and the bank can only absorb the loss if it has enough capital, enough of a cushion, enough of a buffer between the loans it has made and the deposits it holds. The capital requirement says: for every hundred dollars you lend, you must hold some amount of your own money in reserve, so that when the losses come, and the losses always come, you can absorb them without collapsing and taking your depositors with you.

This is sensible. This is the lesson of every banking crisis in history, from the panics of the nineteenth century to the Great Depression to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. Banks that do not hold enough capital fail, and when banks fail, ordinary people lose their money, and when ordinary people lose their money, the economy contracts, and when the economy contracts, more people lose their money, and the cycle feeds itself until something breaks it. Capital requirements are the thing that is supposed to prevent the cycle from starting. They are the light. They are the regulation. They are the thing that keeps the system visible and accountable and, in theory, safe.

But capital requirements also limit profitability. Every dollar held in reserve is a dollar that cannot be lent out, and a dollar that cannot be lent out is a dollar that is not earning interest, and a dollar that is not earning interest is a dollar that is not generating return for the bank's shareholders. The bank wants to lend more. The regulation says it cannot lend more unless it raises more capital. Raising more capital is expensive. Raising more capital dilutes existing shareholders. Raising more capital is, from the perspective of a bank trying to maximize returns, a problem.

The shadow solves the problem.

The mechanism is called a synthetic risk transfer, and it works like this. The bank has a portfolio of loans. The loans are on its balance sheet. The regulator looks at the balance sheet and says: you must hold capital against these loans, because these loans carry risk, and the risk requires a buffer. The bank does not want to hold the capital. The bank wants to free the capital for other uses, for more lending, for higher returns. So the bank enters into a transaction with a counterparty, usually a private credit fund or a hedge fund or a special purpose vehicle, in which the counterparty agrees to absorb the losses on the loan portfolio in exchange for a fee. The loans stay on the bank's balance sheet. The bank still owns them. The bank still collects the interest payments. But the risk, the economic exposure to default, has been transferred to the counterparty. The bank has the loans but not the risk. The counterparty has the risk but not the loans. The bank can now go to the regulator and say: these loans are no longer risky to me, because someone else is bearing the risk, and therefore I should not have to hold as much capital against them.

The regulator, in many jurisdictions, agrees. The capital is freed. The bank can lend more. The bank's return on equity goes up. The shareholders are pleased. The counterparty, the shadow entity, earns a fee for absorbing the risk, a fee that is attractive because the counterparty does not face the same capital requirements that the bank faces, because the counterparty is not a bank, because the counterparty is in the shadow, outside the regulatory perimeter, in the space where the rules do not reach.

The risk has not disappeared. The risk has moved. It has moved from the lit side of the system, where it was visible, where it was measured, where capital was held against it, where a regulator was watching, to the dark side, where it is not visible, where it is not measured in the same way, where no regulator requires a buffer, where no one is watching with the same intensity. The risk is the same risk. The loans are the same loans. The borrowers are the same borrowers who may or may not default. The probability of default has not changed. The severity of default has not changed. What has changed is the location of the risk. It has moved from the light into the shadow.

And in the shadow, the risk can be leveraged. The private credit fund that absorbs the risk does not have to hold capital against it in the way a bank does. The fund can use borrowed money to amplify its exposure. The fund can take on more risk than a bank would be permitted to take on, because the fund is not subject to the same rules, because the fund is not a bank, because the fund is in the shadow. The leverage amplifies the returns when things go well and amplifies the losses when things go badly, and the amplified losses, when they come, do not stay in the shadow. They propagate. They travel through the connections between the shadow entity and the bank that originated the transaction, through the connections between the shadow entity and its own lenders, through the connections between those lenders and their counterparties, through the web of financial relationships that links the lit system to the shadow system at a thousand points of contact, each one a channel through which losses can flow from the dark into the light.

This is happening now. This is not a description of 2008. This is a description of the current financial system, the one that exists today, the one that holds your money. The private credit market has grown from approximately 500 billion dollars in 2015 to over 1.5 trillion dollars by 2024. Synthetic risk transfers are accelerating. Banks are originating loans, transferring the risk to shadow entities, freeing capital, originating more loans, transferring more risk. The shadow is growing. The shadow has been growing for years, and the growth is not hidden, it is reported in financial publications and discussed at industry conferences and analyzed by researchers, and the growth continues because the incentives that drive it have not changed, because the geometry has not changed, because the light source is regulation and the shadow grows in proportion to the distance from the light source and the distance is increasing.

The instruments are more sophisticated now than they were in 2007. The collateralized loan obligation, the CLO, is the current vehicle of choice. A CLO works like this. A manager assembles a portfolio of leveraged loans, typically 200 to 300 loans to companies that are already significantly indebted. The portfolio is pooled into a single entity. The entity issues securities, and the securities are divided into tranches, layers, like geological strata. The senior tranche sits at the top. It gets paid first. It absorbs losses last. It is, in theory, the safest part of the structure. The mezzanine tranches sit in the middle. They get paid after the senior tranche. They absorb losses sooner. They are riskier and they pay higher returns. The equity tranche sits at the bottom. It gets paid last. It absorbs losses first. It is the riskiest part of the structure and it pays the highest returns and it is the part that disappears first when the loans in the portfolio begin to default.

The magic of the CLO, the thing that makes it useful, the thing that makes it dangerous, is the tranching. You start with a pool of risky loans. You slice the pool into layers. The senior layer, because it is protected by the layers below it, can be rated AAA, the highest possible credit rating, the rating that says this is almost as safe as a government bond, this is as close to riskless as a financial instrument can be. The risky loans have been transformed, through the alchemy of structure, into a security that is rated as safe. The risk has not disappeared. The risk is in the lower tranches, in the mezzanine and the equity, in the layers that absorb the first losses. But the senior tranche, the largest tranche, the one that institutional investors and pension funds and insurance companies can buy because their mandates require them to hold only highly-rated securities, the senior tranche is rated AAA, and the rating is, within the assumptions of the model, defensible, and the assumptions of the model are, under normal conditions, reasonable, and the conditions are not always normal, and when the conditions become abnormal the assumptions fail and the rating fails and the AAA tranche that was supposed to be safe turns out to be sitting on top of a structure that is falling apart from the bottom up.

This is what happened in 2008 with CDOs, which are the structural predecessors of CLOs. The same principle. The same tranching. The same transformation of risky loans into supposedly safe securities. The same failure mode when the underlying loans defaulted in numbers that exceeded the model's assumptions. The CLO market has been told that it is different from the CDO market, that the loans are different, that the structures are more conservative, that the lessons have been learned. The CLO market may be right. The CLO market may also be telling itself a story that allows it to continue doing what is profitable, which is what the CDO market told itself, which is what every shadow system tells itself, which is that this shadow is different from the last shadow, that this darkness is not the dangerous kind of darkness, that this time the thing in the dark is friendly.

The shadow financial system is not a peripheral phenomenon. It is not a minor variation on the main theme. It is, by many measures, the main theme. Global shadow banking assets are estimated at over 60 trillion dollars. In some countries, shadow banking assets exceed the assets of the traditional banking system. The shadow is larger than the source. The absence is bigger than the presence. The thing we are not looking at is the larger thing.

The shadow economy has faces. It is important to say this because the phrase "shadow economy" sounds abstract, sounds like a topic for economists and policy papers, sounds like a line on a graph. It is not a line on a graph. It is a woman in Lagos sitting on a plastic stool behind a folding table on which are arranged rows of small denomination phone credit vouchers, scratch cards, each one worth a few hundred naira, each one sold for a tiny margin, the margin so thin that the woman must sell hundreds of cards a day to make what would, in the formal economy, be considered a living wage, and the woman is not in the formal economy, and the woman has never been in the formal economy, and the formal economy does not know she exists.

She is not registered as a business. She does not have a tax identification number. She does not file returns. She does not appear in any government database as a participant in economic activity. She appears in no statistic. She contributes to no official measure of GDP. If you relied solely on the official numbers, on the lit economy, on the data that governments collect and economists analyze, this woman does not exist. Her labor does not exist. The service she provides, the phone credit that allows people in her neighborhood to make calls and send messages and access the internet, that service does not exist in any formal accounting.

And yet she is there. She is there every morning, setting up the table, arranging the cards, sitting in the heat, waiting for customers, making change from a pouch tied at her waist, conducting transactions that are entirely real, that involve real goods and real money and real human needs, that keep the communications infrastructure of her neighborhood functioning at the last mile, at the point where the formal telecom system's distribution network ends and the informal one begins. She is the shadow of the telecom system. She is the last node, the one that connects the network to the street, the one that the company's annual report does not mention and the regulator does not see.

She is not alone. She is one of, in Nigeria alone, tens of millions. The shadow economy in Nigeria is estimated at 50 to 65 percent of GDP. More than half of the country's economic output. More than half of all the work, all the production, all the service, all the value. The formal economy, the one in the statistics, the one that international institutions measure and rate and lend against, is the smaller part. The shadow is the larger part. The woman on the stool with the phone cards is the economy. The thing we measure is the shadow of the economy. We have it backwards.

In India, the shadow economy is estimated at 20 to 50 percent of GDP, depending on the methodology and the year and the willingness of the estimator to acknowledge how little the formal measurement captures. The construction industry in India is heavily dependent on informal labor. The men who build the buildings, who pour the concrete, who lay the bricks, who wire the electricity, who plumb the water, are frequently paid in cash, unregistered, unprotected by labor law, invisible to the formal economy. They build the formal economy. They are not in the formal economy. They are the shadow labor force, the workers in the dark, the people who construct the lit world and are not counted in it.

Domestic labor, globally, is overwhelmingly shadow labor. The nannies, the cleaners, the cooks, the caregivers, the people who maintain the households that allow the formal workforce to function, who watch the children while the parents go to the office, who clean the house while the family is at work, who cook the meals that fuel the bodies that sit at the desks that produce the output that appears in the GDP statistics. Domestic labor makes the formal economy possible. Domestic labor is almost entirely outside the formal economy. The shadow enables the light. The light does not acknowledge the shadow. The GDP does not include the childcare that makes the GDP possible.

The World Bank estimates the global shadow economy at roughly 30 percent of global GDP. Thirty trillion dollars, give or take. A number so large that it is meaningless as a number and meaningful only as a proportion. Nearly a third of everything that humans do, economically, occurs in the shadow. Nearly a third of all labor, all production, all exchange, all value creation on the planet happens outside the formal system, outside the light, outside the measurement, outside the statistics that governments and economists and international institutions use to understand the world. The understanding is incomplete. The understanding has always been incomplete. The understanding is based on the lit part, and the lit part is the smaller part, and the shadow has been there all along, doing most of the work.

The United Kingdom has a Shadow Cabinet, and it is worth spending a moment on what this actually means in practice, because the phrase "Shadow Cabinet" sounds ceremonial, sounds like a parliamentary curiosity, a quaint British tradition involving wigs and maces and archaic titles. It is not ceremonial. It is a working institution, staffed by working politicians, doing real work every day, and the work is the work of watching.

When the Chancellor of the Exchequer presents a budget, the Shadow Chancellor must respond. Not the next day. Not the next week. Immediately. Within hours, often within minutes. The Shadow Chancellor stands in the House of Commons and delivers a detailed, substantive critique of the budget, addressing its assumptions, its projections, its tax changes, its spending commitments. The critique must be specific. It must be informed. It must demonstrate mastery of the numbers, the models, the economic logic. The Shadow Chancellor cannot say "we disagree in principle." The Shadow Chancellor must say "the revenue projection on page 47 assumes a growth rate of 1.8 percent, which is inconsistent with the OBR's own forecast of 1.4 percent, and the discrepancy understates the likely deficit by approximately 12 billion pounds." This level of detail requires work. Sustained, unglamorous, daily work.

Each shadow minister maintains a team. The team monitors every decision, every announcement, every policy change made by the corresponding government minister. They read the same briefings. They attend the same committee hearings. They review the same data. They develop alternative policies, fully costed, fully argued, ready to be implemented. They are governing in theory. They are preparing to govern in practice. They are doing everything that governing requires except the actual governing, the actual exercise of power, the actual ability to make things happen.

The Shadow Cabinet meets weekly, the same day the actual Cabinet meets. They discuss the same issues. They arrive at their own positions. They prepare their own responses. They are a mirror, a reflection, a government-shaped absence where a government would be if the electorate had chosen differently. And the mirror is not passive. The mirror watches. The mirror scrutinizes. The mirror asks questions in Parliament, forces debates, demands explanations, holds the actual government to account for its decisions in a way that requires the Shadow Cabinet to understand those decisions as well as the people who made them, and sometimes better, because the government minister has staff to do the understanding and the shadow minister has less staff and must understand more directly, must hold more detail in their own head, must be more personally fluent in the policy they shadow.

The formal name for this institution is His Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition. The loyalty is structural, not personal. The opposition is loyal to the system of governance, to the principle that power must be watched, that the lit side must have a shadow, that the exercise of authority requires the existence of an entity whose entire purpose is to scrutinize that exercise. The shadow exists to watch the light. The shadow exists because the light, left unwatched, tends to do things that the light would prefer not to be scrutinized, and the shadow's job is to ensure that the scrutiny occurs, relentlessly, daily, in detail, forever.

There is something in this that connects to every other shadow we have examined. The shadow is where the watching happens. The shadow banking system watches for opportunities that the regulated system cannot exploit. The shadow economy watches for needs that the formal economy does not serve. The Shadow Cabinet watches for errors that the government does not acknowledge. In every case, the shadow is the attentive part. The shadow is the part that is paying attention. The light is busy being the light, being visible, being official, being the thing that everyone looks at, and the shadow is doing the quiet work of noticing what the light is doing, and the noticing is the shadow's power, and the noticing is what makes the shadow, in every domain, indispensable.

In 1915, the Equitable Building was completed at 120 Broadway in Lower Manhattan. It rose 538 feet from the sidewalk, straight up, no setbacks, no tapering, no concession to the street below or the buildings beside it. It was not the tallest building in New York. It was, in one specific sense, the most aggressive. Other tall buildings of the era tapered, stepped back, made some gesture toward the sky and the street. The Equitable Building did not. It rose from its lot line as a sheer wall of limestone and occupied every square foot of its site from the ground to the roof, a cliff face in the middle of a city, a building that treated the air rights above its property as absolute and the light rights of its neighbors as nonexistent.

The shadow it cast covered approximately seven acres.

Seven acres is roughly five and a half football fields. Seven acres of Lower Manhattan, some of the most densely populated and most expensive real estate on the planet, fell into permanent shadow. Not twilight. Not partial shade. The streets directly north of the Equitable Building were in full shadow for most of the day. The buildings across the street received no direct sunlight in their lower floors. Offices that had been bright became dark. Apartments that had been pleasant became gloomy, damp, cold in winter in a way that was not merely uncomfortable but pathological, the kind of cold that settles in walls and does not leave, that makes the air feel heavy, that makes the space feel smaller, that makes the people in the space feel, without quite knowing why, that something is wrong with where they live.

Property values in the shadowed area declined. This was measurable, documented, entered into the public record. Buildings that had been fully let saw vacancies. Rents dropped. Businesses that depended on foot traffic found the foot traffic rerouted, because people avoid shadowed streets the way they avoid dark alleys, instinctively, without deciding to, the body steering itself toward the light before the mind has formed an opinion. The Equitable Building was profitable. The buildings in its shadow were losing money. The shadow was redistributing economic value, extracting it from the surrounding properties and concentrating it in the building that cast it, a process that is, if you think about it, precisely what shadows do in every other context we have discussed. The shadow absorbs. The shadow takes from the area it covers and gives to the object that casts it, because the object that casts it is the one blocking the light, and blocking the light is, in this context, an economic act, a taking of value, a transfer of wealth from the lit to the unlit.

The outcry was immediate. Property owners. Civic organizations. Public health advocates, who argued that permanent shadow created conditions favorable to disease, that sunlight was a disinfectant, that the denial of sunlight to a street was a denial of health to the people on the street. The language was vivid. The shadowed streets were compared to canyons, to trenches, to the slums of London that Dickens had described, dark and narrow and airless. New York was building itself into darkness. The city that prided itself on ambition and light and the future and the upward thrust of progress was casting itself into shadow, one building at a time, each building taller than the last, each shadow wider, the streets below disappearing into a permanent twilight that no amount of electric lighting could fully remedy because electric light is not sunlight and the body knows the difference.

In 1916, the city passed the Zoning Resolution. It was the first comprehensive zoning law in the United States, and its primary motivation was shadows. Not exclusively, and the resolution addressed other concerns as well, including the separation of residential and commercial uses, but the height and setback regulations that would define the physical form of New York City for the next half century were driven by shadows. By the problem of tall buildings casting too much darkness on the streets below. By the principle that the right to build tall does not include the right to cast your neighbors into permanent shade.

The resolution mandated setbacks. As a building rose above a certain height, determined by a formula that related the building's height to the width of the street it faced, the building had to step back from the lot line. The wider the street, the higher a building could go before the setback was required. A building on a narrow street had to start stepping back almost immediately. A building on a wide avenue could rise higher before the geometry demanded a retreat. The formula was calculating, for each building on each street, the angle of the shadow, the point at which the building's shadow would reach across the street and darken the buildings on the other side beyond an acceptable threshold, and requiring the building to step back before that point was reached.

The formula was shadow mathematics. It was the same mathematics that Eratosthenes used, applied to the urban landscape. Angle of the sun, height of the obstacle, length of the shadow, distance to the affected surface. The variables were the same. The scale was different. Eratosthenes calculated the size of the earth. The New York Zoning Resolution calculated the size of a building's shadow and declared: this far, and no further.

The architects responded. They had no choice but to respond, because the law constrained the shape of their buildings, and the constraint was geometric, and the geometry produced a specific form. A building that steps back as it rises creates a profile that tapers, that narrows, that ascends in stages like a ziggurat or a staircase or a wedding cake. The base is wide, occupying the full lot. The middle steps back. The upper floors step back again. The tower at the top, if there is a tower, can rise without limit, as long as it occupies no more than 25 percent of the lot area, because a slender tower casts a slender shadow, and a slender shadow moves quickly, sweeping across the street rather than sitting on it, and a moving shadow is tolerable in a way that a permanent shadow is not.

This constraint produced the setback skyscraper, and the setback skyscraper became the architectural identity of New York. The Chrysler Building, completed in 1930, with its terraced crown and its eagle gargoyles and its sunburst spire, steps back in stages that are not arbitrary, that are not purely aesthetic, that correspond to the shadow formula that the 1916 resolution imposed. The Empire State Building, completed in 1931, rises in setbacks that widen the sky above Fifth Avenue, that keep the street below in sunlight for more hours of the day than a straight-sided tower of the same height would permit. 30 Rockefeller Plaza. The Waldorf-Astoria. The GE Building. The entire generation of New York skyscrapers built between 1916 and 1961, when a new zoning resolution replaced the old one, share this vocabulary. They step. They taper. They retreat as they rise. They are shaped by shadow.

And the architects made the constraint beautiful. This is the part that is easy to miss and that deserves attention, because it is not inevitable that a legal constraint should produce beauty, and in this case it did. The setback requirement could have produced ugly buildings. It could have produced monotonous stepped blocks, functional and graceless, complying with the letter of the law and nothing more. Instead, the architects of the 1920s and 1930s took the setback and made it an expressive element. They ornamented the setback lines. They used the stepping to create visual rhythm, to give the building a sense of ascent, of aspiration, of upward movement. They clad the setbacks in terra cotta and limestone and chrome and stainless steel. They turned the shadow regulation into Art Deco, and Art Deco became the visual identity of New York, the style that the world associates with the city, the style that means ambition and glamour and modernity and the future, and the style was a response to shadows. The Chrysler Building is a shadow document. The Empire State Building is a shadow document. The skyline of midtown Manhattan, seen from across the East River, from the observation deck of the new buildings in Brooklyn, from an airplane descending into LaGuardia, that skyline is a shadow document, every step and every taper a sentence in a legal argument about light and its absence, written in steel and stone and glass, legible from miles away, and almost nobody who looks at it knows what they are reading.

Shadows have legal standing. They have had legal standing in New York since 1916. The right to not be cast into permanent shadow by a neighboring building is a right that can be regulated, litigated, enforced. Absence has standing in court. The darkness that a building casts is not merely an inconvenience. It is a taking. The building takes light from the street. The building takes value from the neighboring property. And the law says: you may build, but you must step back. You may rise, but you must make room for the light. You may cast a shadow, but the shadow has limits, and the limits are enforceable, and the shape of your ambition must accommodate the shape of your shadow.

The skyline of New York is a negotiation between buildings and their shadows. Every setback is a concession. Every taper is a compromise. Every stepped silhouette against the sky is the visible record of a conversation between a building's desire to rise and the city's need for light. The conversation has been ongoing for more than a century. The conversation is written in the shapes of the buildings. The conversation is the skyline.

There is a pattern in all of this, and the pattern operates at every scale and in every domain we have examined, and the pattern is worth being explicit about, because the pattern is the same pattern, and because recognizing it changes what you see when you look at any sufficiently complex system.

Every system of sufficient complexity generates a shadow system. The banking system generates shadow banking. The government generates a shadow government. The economy generates a shadow economy. The city generates shadows that reshape the city. The technology department generates shadow IT, the unofficial tools and workarounds and personal accounts that employees use because the official tools are too slow or too cumbersome or too limited, and shadow IT accounts, in most large organizations, for 30 to 50 percent of actual technology spending, which means that roughly a third of the tools that companies actually use to do actual work are tools that nobody in the IT department sanctioned or supports or even knows about. The formal negotiations generate shadow diplomacy, the back channels where the real terms are set, the secret meetings that precede the public ones, the Oslo Accords negotiated in quiet before being announced in public, the opening to China preceded by Kissinger's secret visits, the official process performing what the shadow process already decided.

The pattern is structural. It is not a flaw. It is not a failure. It is not a sign that something has gone wrong. It is a feature of complexity itself. When a system becomes complex enough, when it accumulates enough rules and enough structure and enough formal apparatus, it inevitably creates the conditions for a parallel system to emerge alongside it. The parallel system follows the shape of the original. It mirrors the original's structure. It performs the original's functions. But it operates in the dark, in the unregulated space, in the gap between the rules and the reality, in the shadow.

And the shadow system, in every case we have examined, is larger or more consequential or more dangerous than the visible system. The shadow banking system was larger than the banking system before 2008 and is growing larger again. The shadow economy is the majority of economic activity in many countries and nearly a third of global GDP. The shadow is where the real risk accumulates. The shadow is where the real work happens. The shadow is where the real power concentrates. And the power concentrates there precisely because it is the shadow, precisely because it is the unlit part, the unwatched part, the part that oversight has not reached.

The geometry is the same geometry that governs light and objects and surfaces. The shadow grows in proportion to the distance from the light source. The light source, for institutions, is oversight. Regulation. Scrutiny. Attention. The further a system operates from oversight, the larger its shadow grows. The less regulation applied to the financial system, the larger the shadow banking system becomes. The less attention paid to the informal economy, the larger it becomes. Distance from the light determines the size of the shadow. This is true for buildings on Broadway and it is true for banks in London and it is true for economies in Lagos and it is true for governments in Westminster. The geometry does not change. Only the medium changes.

And the word that we chose for all of this, independently, in every domain, was shadow. Not because anyone was thinking about optics. Because the word was right. Because the thing we were describing was a shadow, in the precise geometric sense: a dark shape cast by a lit structure, attached to its source, following its shape, growing in proportion to the distance from the light.

We have been telling ourselves the truth about shadows for as long as we have had the word. We have been encoding in our language the same principles that govern the shadows on the ground. The shadow is where the information is. The shadow is where the consequence is. The shadow is the part we are not looking at, and the part we are not looking at is the part that determines what happens next.
