## II. LIGHT

There is a form of portraiture that predates photography by centuries and that was, for a long period of European history, the most common way for ordinary people to possess an image of someone they loved.

It required no paint. No canvas. No artistic training. No money to speak of. It required a candle, a piece of paper, a pencil, and a pair of scissors. You sat your subject in a chair, positioned between the candle and a wall. The candle cast the subject's shadow onto the wall, a dark silhouette of the profile, magnified slightly by the proximity of the flame to the head. You pinned a piece of white paper to the wall where the shadow fell. You traced the outline of the shadow with a pencil, following the contour of the forehead, the nose, the lips, the chin, the line of the jaw into the neck. You took down the paper, cut along the penciled line, and mounted the cutout on a contrasting background. Black paper on white card, or sometimes white on black, depending on the convention of the period and the preference of the maker.

What you had was a portrait made entirely of absence. A representation that contained no detail, no color, no expression, no indication of the eyes or the mouth or the particular quality of the skin. No information about whether the subject was smiling or serious, whether their eyes were open or closed, whether they were happy to be sitting for this or enduring it with the quiet patience of a person doing something they had been asked to do by someone they loved. What you had was an outline. The shape of a person, in profile, rendered in the geometry of their shadow. Nothing else.

The word silhouette comes from Étienne de Silhouette, a French finance minister who served under Louis XV for approximately eight months in 1759 before being forced out of office. His tenure was marked by austerity measures so severe and so broadly unpopular that his name became a byword for cheapness. Anything done on the cheap, anything stripped to its barest minimum, anything that suggested poverty or parsimony was said to be done à la Silhouette. The association was vicious. It was meant to sting. When the cheapest possible form of portraiture became fashionable in the decades following his disgrace, it inherited his name, and the name was a joke. A silhouette was the portrait you got when you couldn't afford a portrait. It was the image of the person who wasn't worth painting.

Silhouette portraiture spread anyway. It spread because it was cheap, and cheap meant accessible, and accessible meant that for the first time in the history of image-making, ordinary people could possess a physical representation of a human face. Before the silhouette, portraiture was the province of the wealthy. You commissioned a painter. You sat for hours, sometimes days. You paid a fee that would represent weeks or months of an average laborer's wages. The result was an oil painting, detailed and lifelike, rendered in color, capturing the subject in three-quarter view with careful attention to the fall of light on skin, to the texture of fabric, to the particular way this person's eyes caught the studio light. These portraits were objects of luxury, of status, of power. They hung in the houses of the rich and they depicted the rich and they were made for the rich and the idea that a common person might possess a painted portrait of their spouse or their child or their parent was, for most of history, not a possibility anyone considered.

The silhouette changed this. Traveling silhouettists appeared at markets, at fairs, at public gatherings, offering to cut a profile for a few pennies. The process was fast. A sitting took minutes, not hours. The silhouettist was not an artist in the way that a portrait painter was an artist. The silhouettist was a tracer and a cutter, a craftsperson whose skill was steadiness of hand, not depth of vision. The candle did the seeing. The shadow did the rendering. The silhouettist followed the outline that the shadow provided and cut along it, and what emerged was not an interpretation of the subject but a mechanical record, a transcription, a direct physical trace of the subject's shadow captured on paper and fixed there by the act of cutting.

People lined up for this. People who had never owned an image of anyone, who had never seen their own profile, who had no way to know the shape of their own face as seen from the side. They sat down in front of a candle and let the flame cast their shadow and watched the silhouettist trace and cut and produce, in a few minutes, a small black shape on white card that was, unmistakably, recognizably, them. Their forehead. Their nose. The particular jut of their chin or the slope of their neck. Recognizable not because of detail but because of contour. Because the outline of a human face is, it turns out, as unique as a fingerprint, as distinctive as a voice. You can recognize a person you know from their silhouette alone. The profile is a signature. The shadow carries it.

And people treasured them. This is the part that should not be rushed past. People kept silhouettes in lockets, wore them around their necks, carried them when they traveled. They framed them and hung them on walls. They gave them as gifts to lovers, to children leaving home, to friends moving to distant cities in an era when moving to a distant city meant, in most cases, never seeing the person again. The silhouette was the last image. The thing you carried when you left. The thing you held when you could not hold the person.

When the subject died, the silhouette became something else. It became the image of the dead. Often the only image. For most people in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, there was no other kind of image available. No painting. No photograph. Photography did not exist yet, and when it arrived it would make the silhouette obsolete almost overnight, but for the long century before photography, the silhouette was it. The only image of the dead was the shadow of the dead, traced by candlelight and cut from paper, kept in a locket or hung on a wall, looked at in the particular way that people look at images of the dead, which is different from the way they look at images of the living, which is different in a way that is difficult to describe and immediately recognizable to anyone who has done it.

The silhouette was sufficient for grief. An outline. The most minimal possible representation of a human being, stripped of every particular except the geometry of the profile. No eyes, no smile, no expression, no color, no life. Just the shape. Just the edge where the person ended and the rest of the world began. And this was enough. A widow could hold the silhouette of her husband and mourn. A mother could hold the silhouette of a dead child and feel the full weight of what she had lost. The outline activated whatever it is in the human brain that recognizes a person, that maps a contour onto an identity, that converts a shape into a presence. The silhouette did not contain the person. It suggested the person. It offered the faintest possible hint of the shape of someone, and the faintest possible hint was sufficient. The grief did not need a detailed portrait. The grief needed an edge. A boundary. The line where the person was.

The silhouette is a shadow. Not like a shadow. Not reminiscent of a shadow. A shadow. The subject sat between a light source and a surface, the subject's shadow fell on the surface, and the shadow was traced. The image was produced not by the artist's eye or the artist's hand but by the candle's light and the subject's opacity. The subject made their own portrait by blocking light. The portrait was the shape of the light they blocked. This is what a shadow is. This is what a shadow has always been. The first portable, keepable, shareable image of an ordinary human being was a shadow, traced and cut and kept and mourned over. Portraiture for the common person began with absence.

Photography arrived in 1839 and killed the silhouette within a generation. The daguerreotype, the calotype, the wet plate, the dry plate, the roll film, the digital sensor. Each technology different, each one producing images of increasing fidelity, detail, color, realism. Within fifty years of photography's invention, the silhouette was a curiosity, a folk art, a thing grandmothers remembered from their childhood. Nobody needed to trace a shadow on a wall when you could capture the full face, the full expression, the full color and texture and specificity of a person in a photograph.

But the photograph did not escape the shadow. It could not. The mechanism would not allow it.

Here is how a photograph works, and the how matters, because the how is where the shadow is hiding. Light from a scene enters a lens. Already this is a shadow operation, because the lens works by bending light, by refracting it, by taking the chaotic spray of photons bouncing off every surface in every direction and organizing them, focusing them, persuading them to converge on a single plane. The lens is a funnel for light. It takes the world's scattered illumination and concentrates it into a pattern on a surface.

The surface, in a film camera, is coated with silver halide crystals. Tiny grains of silver bromide or silver chloride or silver iodide, suspended in gelatin, spread across a strip of flexible plastic. When a photon hits a silver halide crystal with sufficient energy, it triggers a chemical reaction. The crystal changes. Not visibly, not yet, but at the molecular level, a latent image forms, a ghost of the light that struck it, invisible until the film is developed, until the chemistry of development amplifies the ghost into something the eye can see. Where lots of photons arrived, many crystals are changed, and the developed film is dark. Where few photons arrived, few crystals are changed, and the film is light. The negative is the inverse of the scene. The darks are light and the lights are dark, which means the negative is, quite literally, the shadow of the scene. The places that were bright in reality are dark on the negative because the brightness converted the crystals, and the converted crystals block light when you shine it through the negative to make a print. The photograph begins as a shadow. The negative is a shadow record, an absence map, a document of where light arrived and where it did not.

In a digital camera the silver halide is replaced by a grid of photosensitive elements, tiny electronic detectors, each one generating an electrical charge proportional to the light it receives. More light, more charge. Less light, less charge. No light, no charge. The grid is a matrix of measurements, millions of them, each one recording the intensity of illumination at a single point. The result is the same as film in principle and different in mechanism. A map. A point-by-point record of where light was strong, where it was weak, where it was absent. A shadow map with very high resolution.

What makes a face visible in a photograph is the fact that a face interacts with light in a way that is unique to that face. Your forehead reflects light differently than your cheek. Your cheek reflects differently than the shadow beneath your jaw. Your eyes absorb almost everything that enters them, which is why pupils are dark, which is why the eyes in a photograph are always the darkest part of the face, small wells of absorption in a landscape of reflection. The specific pattern of light and dark that a face produces when illuminated is as unique as the face itself. No two faces produce the same pattern. The camera captures this pattern and preserves it and the preservation is the photograph and the photograph is, at the most fundamental level, a record of what a face did to light. How it redirected it. How it absorbed it. How it blocked it. How it cast a shadow on the recording surface that was shaped exactly like the face that cast it.

Every photograph is a shadow of its subject cast onto a recording surface. Every portrait is an absence in the shape of a presence. This is not a poetic restatement. It is a description of the physics. The photograph records what the subject did to light, and what the subject did to light was cast a shadow, and the shadow is the photograph.

The earliest photographs make this connection more viscerally obvious than modern ones. A daguerreotype is a polished silver plate that has been exposed to iodine vapor and then to light and then to mercury vapor, and the resulting image has a quality that no other photographic process has replicated. It is silvery, spectral, fragile-looking. The image appears and disappears as you tilt the plate, visible only at certain angles, ghostly at others, the face emerging from the mirror surface and then sinking back into it as the angle changes, as though the subject were rising to the surface of the silver and then submerging again, as though the portrait were not fixed but fluid, not permanent but contingent on how you held it and where you stood and how the light fell on the plate that held the light that fell on the face. Daguerreotypes look like hauntings. They look like what you would get if you could photograph a ghost. They look, more than any subsequent photographic technology, like shadows.

And the Victorians photographed their dead.

This is not morbid trivia. This is not a curiosity of a bygone era mentioned for shock value. This was widespread, mainstream, practiced across all social classes, and it makes complete sense once you understand the economics of early photography. Photographs were expensive. A daguerreotype portrait cost between a few cents and several dollars in the 1840s and 1850s, which does not sound like much until you adjust for the era and the income levels involved. For many families, a photograph was a once-in-a-lifetime expense. You might be photographed once. Perhaps at a wedding. Perhaps at the birth of a child. Perhaps never, because the occasion never presented itself or the money was never available or the nearest photographic studio was in a city you had no reason to visit.

And then someone died. A child, often. Infant mortality in the nineteenth century was staggering by modern standards. One in four children born in the United States in the mid-1800s did not survive to their fifth birthday. And for a family that had never had the occasion or the means to photograph their child while the child was alive, the death of the child was, perversely, the occasion. The photographer was sent for. The body was posed. Sometimes seated in a chair, propped up with hidden supports. Sometimes lying in a crib or a bed, arranged to look as though sleeping. Sometimes held by a living parent or sibling, the dead child cradled in living arms, the composition arranged to suggest intimacy rather than death.

The eyes were the problem. Closed eyes meant sleep or death. Open eyes meant life. The families wanted life. Sometimes the photographer would paint open eyes onto the closed eyelids of the corpse. Sometimes the photograph would be retouched afterward, the painted eyes added to the print. Sometimes the lids were physically propped open, though this was less common and less successful, because dead eyes do not focus and the resulting photographs have a quality that is worse than closed eyes, a blankness, an emptiness in the gaze that reads not as life but as something else, something that does not have a name in the vocabulary of portraiture.

The exposure times in early photography were long. Seconds, sometimes minutes. The subject needed to hold perfectly still. Living subjects struggled with this. They shifted, they breathed, they blinked, and the resulting images show traces of this movement, a slight blur to the features, a softness, a ghostliness. The living look spectral in early photographs. They look like they are in the process of fading.

The dead did not move. The dead held perfectly still for as long as the exposure required. And the resulting images have an eerie, paradoxical clarity. The dead child is the sharpest figure in the photograph. The living parent holding the dead child is blurred, ghostly, half-present. The dead child is crisp, defined, fully there. The person who is gone is the most vivid presence in the image. The people who remain are the ones who look like shadows.

These photographs were treasured the way silhouettes were treasured. Kept in cases, in albums, on mantels. Looked at in that particular way. The image of the dead. The shadow of the person who is not here. The record that persists when the subject is gone. The technology had advanced from candle and scissors to lens and silver halide, but the function was the same. The function had always been the same. Keep the shadow. Hold the absence. Preserve, in whatever medium is available, the shape of the person who will not be coming back.

We carry these records everywhere now. Not in lockets, not in cases. In our pockets. Every phone contains photographs of people, and some of those people are dead, and the photographs are shadows. The light that bounced off your grandmother's face at a specific moment on a specific day entered a lens and struck a recording surface and was fixed there, and the light is gone now, the photons absorbed, their energy converted to chemical change or electrical signal, their journey ended. Your grandmother, if she has died, is gone. The pattern persists. You scroll through your phone and you pass through shadows. Images of people at barbecues, at weddings, at the beach, in kitchens, in hospital beds, at moments they did not know were being recorded and moments they posed for carefully with that particular self-consciousness that people have when they know a camera is pointed at them, the slight stiffening, the performed smile, the version of themselves they wanted the camera to see, which is its own kind of shadow.

Some of the people in the photographs are alive. Some are dead. The photographs do not tell you which. The shadow of the living and the shadow of the dead look the same. Both are records of light that was reflected by a body that is not currently present. In one case the body is elsewhere. In the other case the body is nowhere. The photograph cannot distinguish between elsewhere and nowhere. The pattern is the pattern. The absence looks the same regardless of whether the absent thing still exists somewhere outside the frame.

Every image of the dead is a shadow. This was true of the silhouette in 1780 and the daguerreotype in 1845 and the Polaroid in 1972 and the JPEG on your phone right now. The technology changes. The principle does not. Light interacts with a subject. The interaction is recorded. The subject moves on or ceases to exist. The record persists. The record is a shadow. The shadow is what we keep.

There is a theory about cave paintings that may or may not be true and that is, either way, beautiful.

The theory is that some of the earliest known paintings, the ones in caves in southern France and northern Spain, dating to thirty thousand or forty thousand years ago, depicting animals in motion on the curved walls of underground chambers, were not drawn from observation or memory or imagination. They were traced from shadows.

Firelight, inside a cave, is not steady. It moves. It sputters and leaps and casts moving shadows on the walls, and the walls are not flat. They are curved, ridged, bulging, folded, and the moving light on the uneven surface creates shadow-shapes that shift and flicker and, under the right conditions, suggest forms. A ridge in the rock, lit from below by a guttering fire, casts a shadow that resembles the hump of a bison. A stalactite's shadow becomes an antler. A concavity in the wall, in the right light at the right angle, looks like the haunch of a horse. The cave itself, in firelight, is a kind of accidental theater. The performance is natural, unscripted, unrepeatable. Every fire casts different shadows. Every flicker produces a different show.

The theory suggests that the first artists were the people who saw the animals in the shadows and traced them. Who noticed, in the flickering dark, a shape that looked like something, and reached out with a piece of charcoal or a finger dipped in ochre and followed the outline on the rock. Who converted the shadow into a mark, the accident into a record, the momentary into the permanent. The theory explains why so many cave paintings seem to use the natural contours of the cave wall as part of the image, why a bulge in the rock becomes the belly of a horse, why a crack becomes a spear, why the paintings look less like images applied to a surface and more like images discovered in a surface, drawn out of the stone by someone who was working with the wall rather than on it, collaborating with the rock and the light, the three of them together producing the image.

The theory is contested. Many archaeologists find the evidence circumstantial. The paintings could have been made from memory, from imagination, from direct observation of animals outside the cave and then rendered underground by the light of the same fires that would, in the theory, have produced the shadows being traced. The theory may be wrong.

But if it is right. If the first art was shadow-tracing. If the earliest images were outlines of absences, captured on stone by firelight, preserved in pigment while the shadows themselves flickered and moved on and ceased to exist.

Then the history of visual representation begins with a traced shadow in a cave. Forty thousand years ago, someone made a shadow permanent. They took the most ephemeral thing in the world, an absence that existed only while the fire burned and the light fell at the right angle, and they fixed it. Charcoal on limestone. Ochre on granite. The shadow is gone, has been gone for forty thousand years, was gone the moment the fire shifted. The tracing remains. The tracing is still there, in the cave, on the wall, in the dark, and it will be there for as long as the stone holds, which is to say longer than any person or any civilization or any language or any memory.

The silhouettists of the eighteenth century, tracing profiles by candlelight, were doing something that someone may have done forty thousand years earlier, underground, by firelight, with ochre instead of scissors and stone instead of paper. The technology changed. The principle did not. A light source. A surface. A shadow on the surface. Someone tracing the shadow. The trace is the image. The image is the shadow. The shadow is the beginning.

And shadows, once traced, once fixed, once made permanent by pigment or paper or film or any other technology that converts the momentary into the lasting, become something that shadows in nature never are. They become records. Documents. Evidence that a thing was here, in this light, at this moment, casting this shape. The traced shadow says: something was here. The shadow on the cave wall says: an animal was here, or looked like it was here, or the fire thought it was here. The silhouette in the locket says: a person was here, sitting in this chair, in front of this candle, on this evening. The photograph on your phone says: a person was here, in this light, at this moment, and the light touched them and bounced back and was caught.

The shadow as record. The shadow as evidence. The shadow as the thing that says: something was here and is not here now, and I am what remains.

There is one place on earth where this principle was demonstrated so violently and so completely that it has become impossible to think about shadows the same way afterward.

On the morning of August 6, 1945, at approximately 8:15 a.m., a person was sitting on the stone steps of the Sumitomo Bank in Hiroshima, Japan.

We do not know who this person was. We do not know their name. We do not know their age, their gender, their occupation. We do not know why they were sitting on the steps of a bank at a quarter past eight in the morning. The bank was not yet open. Perhaps they worked there and had arrived early and were waiting for someone with a key. Perhaps they were a customer with business to conduct, first in line, wanting to be done early, wanting to get whatever it was taken care of so the rest of the day could proceed. Perhaps they had no business at the bank at all and simply needed to sit. Perhaps they were tired. Perhaps they were old, or pregnant, or carrying something heavy. Perhaps their shoes were uncomfortable and the steps were there and the steps were cool and there was shade and no particular reason not to rest for a moment on a warm morning in August when the war was still on but the city had not been bombed, not yet, not like the other cities, and there was a rumor that Hiroshima was being spared for some reason, saved for something, though nobody knew what, and the not knowing was its own kind of anxiety but also its own kind of hope, and maybe on this particular morning the person on the steps was not thinking about the war or the bombs or the rumors but was just sitting, just resting, just existing in the warmth of an August morning, doing the thing that people do when they sit on steps, which is nothing, which is wait, which is be.

At 8:15 a.m. the uranium bomb designated Little Boy detonated at an altitude of approximately 580 meters above the city.

The fireball at the center of the detonation reached temperatures exceeding one million degrees Celsius. The fireball expanded outward at enormous speed, heating the air, compressing it, generating a blast wave that would, in the seconds following the initial flash, destroy virtually every structure within a mile of the hypocenter. But the blast wave traveled at the speed of sound, which is slow. The thermal radiation traveled at the speed of light, which is not slow. The light arrived first. The light arrived before anything else, before the sound, before the wind, before the shattered glass and the collapsing buildings and the fires. The light arrived in a fraction of a second and it was, at ground level, brighter than the surface of the sun.

The thermal pulse delivered approximately 100 calories per square centimeter to surfaces near the hypocenter. In practical terms this means that exposed stone and concrete reached temperatures of 3,000 to 4,000 degrees Celsius in a fraction of a second. Granite cracked and flaked. Roof tiles fused together. Wood ignited at distances of over two kilometers. Exposed human skin was burned instantly and catastrophically at distances of more than a kilometer.

The thermal pulse lasted approximately three seconds, but the most intense radiation was concentrated in the first tenth of a second. A tenth of a second. The blink of an eye takes three-tenths of a second. The thermal pulse was over before a blink could complete. In that time, which is not enough time to flinch, not enough time for a nerve signal to travel from the eye to the brain, not enough time for the brain to issue the command to move, in that sliver of duration that does not even register as duration in the human experience of time, the light did something to the city that light does not normally do.

It changed surfaces permanently.

Normally, light illuminates without altering. The sun lights a stone wall every morning and the wall is unchanged at sunset. Photons arrive, interact with the surface, bounce off or are absorbed, and the surface remains what it was. This is what light does. This is what light is supposed to do. The thermal pulse from the bomb did not do this. The thermal pulse carried so much energy in so compressed a time that it acted on surfaces the way a kiln acts on clay. It fired them. It bleached and scorched exposed stone, concrete, asphalt, wood. It stripped color. It altered surface chemistry. It left a permanent mark on every surface it touched, a lightening, a bleaching, a thermal scar that would not fade, that would not heal, that would be there in the stone for as long as the stone existed.

Everything the thermal pulse reached, it marked. And everything that stood between the thermal pulse and a surface, it shadowed.

Because that is what a shadow is. An object between a light source and a surface. The object blocks the light. The surface behind the object is not illuminated. Normally this produces a temporary shadow, a dark shape that exists for as long as the object is there and the light is on. But when the light source is powerful enough to permanently change the surface it reaches, then the shadow is also permanent. The area that was exposed is changed forever. The area that was shielded is unchanged forever. The boundary between the two is permanent. The shadow is permanent.

The thermal pulse was a light source. The city was a recording surface. The objects and people in the city were obstacles. And the thermal pulse, in its fraction of a second, exposed the city the way a flash exposes film.

Poles left shadows on the ground, the asphalt around them bleached and the asphalt behind them dark. Railings left shadows on walls, a row of vertical dark bars on a lightened surface. A valve wheel on the side of a gas storage tank left its circular shadow on the metal, the wheel's shape preserved with mechanical precision, every spoke visible, every curve exact, the thermal pulse recording the wheel the way a camera records a subject, faithfully, without interpretation, without mercy. A ladder leaning against a wall left the shadows of its rungs, evenly spaced, horizontal bars of original color against a scorched background. A bicycle left its shadow. A length of pipe left its shadow. Every object in the path of the flash that stood between the light and a surface left its shadow, and the shadows are still there, or were still there until they were removed and taken to museums, and in the museums they are still there, behind glass, preserved now not by the thermal pulse but by human decision, by the determination that these marks matter, that these absences are records, that these shadows are something we need to keep.

These objects survived the blast. The pole is still there. The valve wheel is still there. The shadows of objects are interesting, and they are precise, and they demonstrate the mechanism clearly. But they are not the thing that stops you.

The shadows of people are the thing that stops you.

A person standing on a road near the hypocenter left their shadow on the asphalt. The thermal pulse bleached the road surface around them and their body blocked the pulse and the road behind them retained its original darker color. The person was destroyed. The shadow remained. A dark shape on a light road. The shape of a person standing. The outline of someone who was on that road at 8:15 in the morning, walking somewhere, going to work, going home, going to buy something, going to meet someone, going nowhere in particular, just walking, just being on that road, and then the flash.

A person near a wall. A person near a bridge. A person sitting on steps.

The person on the steps of the Sumitomo Bank. This is the most well-known of the Hiroshima shadows. The steps were granite, approximately 260 meters from the hypocenter. The thermal pulse bleached the exposed surfaces of the steps, permanently lightening the stone. Where the person sat, where their body intercepted the thermal radiation and shielded the stone behind them, the stone retained its original darker color. The result, which you can see, which still exists, which is in a museum now where you can stand in front of it, is a dark shape on lighter stone. The shape of a person sitting. Leaning slightly, the posture somewhat ambiguous, but sitting. Waiting. The posture of waiting.

The posture of a quarter past eight. Not a quarter past eight and one second. The posture of the moment before the flash. The last moment of the ordinary world. The moment when there was still a person sitting on steps in the morning warmth, waiting for a bank to open, and the waiting was boring and the morning was normal and there was no indication in the light or the air or the sound of the city that the waiting was about to end.

The shadow is still there. The stone steps were cut from the bank building and transported to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. They are displayed behind glass. The glass is clean. The lighting in the museum is soft. There is a small placard with text in Japanese and English that provides the basic facts. Distance from the hypocenter. Approximate time. Description of what you are looking at. The placard is informative and restrained and entirely inadequate, the way all placards next to all artifacts of atrocity are entirely inadequate, because the placard can tell you what the shadow is but it cannot tell you what the shadow means, because what the shadow means is not something that can be communicated in a placard, or in a sentence, or in a paragraph, or possibly at all.

Visitors stand in front of the shadow. Schoolchildren on class trips. Elderly Japanese visitors, some of whom remember. Foreign tourists with cameras and audio guides. They stand in front of it and they look at it and the shadow looks back at them with no face and no eyes and no expression and no identity.

They are looking at a person. They are looking at the absence of a person. They are looking at both of these things at the same time, which is what makes it difficult, which is what makes some visitors stand there for a long time without moving and other visitors glance and walk quickly to the next exhibit and other visitors start to say something and then not say it and other visitors take a photograph and then feel strange about having taken a photograph, which is to say they feel strange about having taken a shadow of a shadow, a light-and-absence record of a light-and-absence record, which is a recursion that leads somewhere that is difficult to follow.

Some of the visitors cry. They did not know the person. They cannot identify the person. The shadow gives them no access to the person's history, their name, their face, the sound of their voice, the way they laughed, the things they cared about, the people who loved them. The visitors are mourning a shape. They are mourning an outline. They are mourning the fact that a person was here, on these steps, doing something utterly ordinary, and then was not here, and the only evidence is this dark mark on stone.

The silhouette was sufficient for grief in 1780 when a widow held a paper cutout of her husband's profile in a locket and wept. The silhouette is sufficient for grief now.

The shadow on the bank steps is the most accurate portrait of this person that will ever exist. This is not a figurative statement. The thermal pulse interacted with the person's body and the stone surface according to the laws of physics, producing a record that contains no artistic interpretation, no stylistic choice, no human decision about what to include and what to emphasize. The shadow includes everything that the physics included, which is the outline of the body, the posture, the contour, the geometry of a person sitting on steps. It is a portrait made by light and stone and the opacity of human flesh, and it is precise in a way that no painting or photograph could be, because paintings and photographs are produced by human beings who make choices, who frame and crop and adjust, and this shadow was produced by thermal radiation, which does not make choices, which does not frame or crop, which simply records what is in its path with the indifference of a process that has no opinion about what it is recording.

And the shadow gives us the body and withholds the person. This is the particular cruelty of it. The shadow is the most precise record of this body's position in space at a given moment that physics can produce. It tells us exactly where the person was sitting, exactly how they were leaning, exactly what angle their torso made with the steps. It tells us the shape of them. The size of them. The contour of them. And it tells us nothing else. Not who they were. Not what they were thinking. Not whether they had children or parents or friends who would search for them in the days after the bombing and never find them and never know what had happened to them, because there was nothing to find. The body was gone. The shadow was there, on the steps, but the shadow does not have a name tag. The shadow does not respond when you call a name. The shadow is the shape without the face. The presence without the identity. The most intimate possible record of a human body and the most impersonal possible record of a human being.

If your mother had been sitting on those steps, you would not recognize her shadow. You would see a person sitting. You would not see your mother. The shadow preserves the body and loses the person. It keeps everything about the shape and nothing about the self. It is the opposite of memory, which keeps the self and loses the shape, which remembers a voice and a laugh and a way of being in the world and forgets, over time, the exact contour of the jaw, the exact slope of the shoulders, the exact posture of sitting. Memory and shadow are inversions of each other. Each preserves what the other loses. Together they would make a complete record. Apart, each is a different kind of absence.

Shadows, under normal conditions, are the most ephemeral things that exist. They last exactly as long as the current configuration of light and object persists. When the configuration changes, the shadow vanishes. Instantly. Completely. Without residue, without remainder, without any trace that it was ever there. Every shadow that has ever been cast on the surface of the earth is gone. The shadow that the Great Pyramid cast on the day Thales measured it is gone. The shadow your body cast yesterday at noon is gone. The shadow that fell across your desk an hour ago, cast by your hand as you reached for a cup, is gone so completely that not even the most sensitive instrument could detect that it had ever existed. Shadows leave no archaeological record. There is no fossil of a shadow. There is no sedimentary layer that preserves the shadow of a fern or a dinosaur or a cloud from a hundred million years ago. Shadows are the most thoroughly present-tense phenomenon in the physical world. They exist only in the moment of their casting. They have no past tense. They are what is happening, never what happened.

The Hiroshima shadows have a past tense.

They are shadows that did not vanish when the light source turned off. They are shadows that have existed for nearly eighty years and will exist for centuries more, possibly millennia, as long as the stone holds. They have a past tense and a future tense. They are the only shadows on earth that do.

The reason they persist is the reason they exist. The thermal pulse was powerful enough to permanently alter stone. A less powerful flash would have illuminated the stone and left no mark. A less powerful flash would have cast temporary shadows, the kind that vanish when the light goes off. A less powerful flash would have left the person alive and the stone unmarked. The permanence of the shadow requires the power of the flash, and the power of the flash requires the destruction of the person. The shadow is permanent because the light was annihilating. The record endures because the recording conditions were lethal. A gentler light would have left no trace. Only this light, this killing light, this light that was strong enough to burn stone and destroy a body in the same fraction of a second, was strong enough to create a permanent shadow.

The conditions that make a shadow permanent are the conditions that make everything else impermanent. The shadow endures because the person does not. The record is made by the destruction of the thing being recorded. You can have the person or the shadow. You cannot have both. The shadow's permanence is purchased by the person's annihilation, and the purchase is not metaphorical, it is physical, it is thermodynamic, it is a direct consequence of the energy involved. The same photons that altered the stone destroyed the body. The same event created the image and eliminated the subject. The creation and the elimination are the same act, occurring in the same fraction of a second, caused by the same light.

In 79 CE, seventeen centuries before Hiroshima, the volcano Vesuvius erupted and buried the city of Pompeii under meters of volcanic ash and pumice. The burial was fast enough and deep enough that the city was preserved more or less as it was at the moment of the eruption. Tables set for meals that would not be eaten. Graffiti on walls, some of it political, some of it obscene, some of it the kind of casual daily expression that normally vanishes within a generation and here survived for two thousand years because a volcano decided to act as an archivist. Bread in ovens, carbonized but recognizable. Wine in jars. A city frozen in the middle of an ordinary day that became, without warning, the last day.

The people who did not escape were buried too. Their bodies were entombed in the falling ash as it settled and hardened around them, forming a shell, a casing, a mold of the space they occupied at the moment the ash reached them. And inside these molds, over the centuries, the bodies decomposed. The flesh dissolved. The organs broke down. The soft tissue was consumed by the slow, patient chemistry of decay, working in the dark, working in silence, turning the body into nothing over hundreds and hundreds of years while the shell of hardened ash held its shape, held the contour, held the memory of the form that had been inside it. What remained, when the decomposition was complete, were bones and a void. A negative space. A cavity in the hardened ash in the exact shape of the body that had been there and was no longer there. The space where a person used to be, preserved with the fidelity of a mold, capturing details that the person themselves would not have thought to preserve, because the person did not choose to be preserved, the person chose to run or to hide or to hold their child or to cover their face, and the ash preserved whatever they were doing at the moment it reached them, without asking, without permission, without regard for whether this was the moment they wanted to be remembered in.

In 1863, the archaeologist Giuseppe Fiorelli understood what the voids were and what could be done with them. He poured liquid plaster of Paris into the cavities through small holes drilled in the hardened ash. The plaster was liquid, thin, and it flowed into every part of the void, every fold, every crevice, conforming to the shape of the absence with the precision of a material that has no agenda and no aesthetic and simply goes where the space is. The plaster filled the void. The plaster hardened. Fiorelli chipped away the surrounding ash and what emerged was a cast. A three-dimensional image of a person at the moment of their death, produced not by an artist's observation or an artist's skill but by filling the hole where the person used to be.

The casts are not sculptures. They are not representations. They are the shapes of absences. They are what you get when you pour something solid into the space that a person left behind. The cast is the person's void made visible, the negative space made positive, the absence converted into a presence that has the exact dimensions, the exact contours, the exact posture of the body that created the void by being there and then, slowly, over centuries, not being there.

A man covering his mouth and nose with a cloth, the cloth folded over his face, his other arm drawn up, the posture of someone trying not to breathe, trying to filter the air, the ash falling and the air becoming poison and the cloth not helping but the man holding it there anyway because what else can you do, what else is there to do when the air itself is killing you and the only response available is to hold a piece of fabric over your face and hope.

A woman on her side, curled inward, knees drawn up, arms across her chest, the posture of self-protection that the body adopts without being told, the ancient mammalian instinct to make yourself small, to curl around your own center, to present the minimum surface to the thing that is hurting you. She did not decide to curl up. Her body decided. The decision is preserved in the plaster.

Two figures together, close, touching, whether embracing in comfort or clutching in terror or simply holding on because the alternative to holding on was being alone, and being alone in this was worse than anything except the thing itself. The cast preserves the contact. The hands are visible. The two bodies are pressed together. The ash filled in around them and hardened and the bodies decomposed and the void that remained was the shape of two people holding each other, and the plaster filled the void, and the plaster holds the shape, and the shape is two people who did not let go.

A child. Small. The cast terribly small. The size of it is the thing that undoes people who look at it. The space that a child's body occupied in the world, which was not much space, which was a small space, which was a space that the ash filled and the centuries emptied and the plaster re-filled, and the plaster child is curled and still and the size of it is the size of a child and the size of a child is the thing that makes it impossible to think about this analytically.

And the dog. Still chained. Twisted on its back, the body contorted, the legs rigid, the mouth open. The cast of the dog is, for many visitors, the most difficult to look at, and the reason is not that the dog suffered more than the people, because the people certainly suffered as much or more. The reason is that the dog did not understand. The dog had no framework for what was happening. No theology. No philosophy. No capacity for the kind of meaning-making that humans bring to catastrophe, the stories we tell ourselves about why, about what it means, about what comes after. The dog had none of this. The dog had only the experience. The ash falling. The air thickening. The chain holding. The body fighting, fighting in the way that animals fight, with everything, without resignation, without the particular human capacity for acceptance or despair. Just the body trying to live. Just the chain not breaking. Just the ash not stopping. The cast preserves every detail of the struggle. Every contortion. Every rigid limb. The open mouth. The chain. The plaster presents it to you across two thousand years with the fidelity of a process that does not know how to soften what it records.

The logic is the same as Hiroshima. The person is gone. The space they occupied is the record. In Hiroshima the record is two-dimensional, a silhouette on stone, the outline of a body. In Pompeii the record is three-dimensional, a cavity in hardened ash, the volume of a body. The dimensionality is different. The timescale is different. In Hiroshima the destruction was instantaneous, a fraction of a second, a flash. In Pompeii the destruction was slow, hours of falling ash, the city buried over the course of an afternoon and evening. But the principle is the same. The person is destroyed. The absence persists. The record is produced by the removal of the thing being recorded, the way a mold is made by the removal of the object that shaped it, the way a footprint is made by the removal of the foot.

Hiroshima and Pompeii are separated by nineteen centuries and by every conceivable difference in technology, culture, geography, cause. A nuclear weapon and a volcanic eruption share nothing except this: both produced permanent records of the dead through the mechanism of destruction. Both demonstrated that under conditions of sufficient violence, the shadow outlasts the body. Both demonstrated that the most durable version of a human being is not the body, which decays, and not the name, which is forgotten, and not the story, which is changed in the retelling until it bears no resemblance to what happened. The most durable version of a human being is the space where the human being was.
