## IV. SELF

In the tomb of Tutankhamun, among the golden masks and the canopic jars and the chariots and the jewelry and the 5,398 objects that Howard Carter spent ten years cataloguing after he broke through the sealed doorway in November 1922, there are paintings on the walls. The paintings depict the journey of the dead king through the underworld, the trials and transformations that the soul must undergo in order to reach the Field of Reeds, the Egyptian paradise, the place of eternal abundance where the crops are always tall and the river never floods too much or too little and the dead live as they lived in life but better, freed from suffering, freed from labor, freed from the particular cruelties of the Nile valley in a dry year.

The paintings show the king's body, the khat, being prepared for burial. They show the ka, the vital force, being released from the body at the moment of death, rising, separating, becoming something that the living cannot see but the dead can feel. They show the heart, the ib, being weighed against the feather of Ma'at in the hall of judgment, the scales balanced by Anubis, the result recorded by Thoth, the ibis-headed god of writing, because in Egyptian theology even the judgment of the dead required paperwork. They show the ba, the personality, depicted as a bird with a human head, flying between the tomb and the world of the living, because the ba could travel, could visit the places the dead person had loved, could sit on the branches of trees in familiar gardens and watch the living go about their lives.

And they show the sheut. The shadow.

The sheut appears in the tomb paintings as a solid black silhouette of the deceased, a dark human figure among the colored figures of the gods and the ka and the ba. It is recognizably a shadow. It looks like a shadow. It has the flatness, the dimensionlessness, the pure dark outline that any shadow has. But it is not cast by anything. It stands on its own. It moves on its own. It is depicted as an independent entity, a component of the person that has separated from the body at death and now exists as its own thing, its own being, its own element of the soul's ecology.

The ancient Egyptians understood the human being as a composite. Not a single thing with a single soul but a collection of parts, each with its own nature, each with its own needs after death, each requiring specific rituals and specific protections to ensure its survival in the afterlife. The body needed mummification. The name needed to be spoken, because a name that was not spoken would fade, and a name that faded would take the person with it, which is why the walls of Egyptian tombs are covered in the name of the deceased, repeated, carved, painted, inscribed in every available surface, because repetition was protection against forgetting, and forgetting was the true death, worse than the death of the body. The ka needed offerings, food and drink left at the tomb, because the ka was hungry, the ka retained the appetites of the living, and a ka that was not fed would wander, would grow angry, would become the kind of restless dead that haunted the living.

And the sheut needed to be preserved. The shadow needed to be protected. The specific rituals of this protection are not fully understood, because the texts that describe them are fragmentary and the translation of ancient Egyptian religious writing is more art than science, the meanings layered and ambiguous and contested by scholars who have spent careers arguing about whether a particular hieroglyph means "protect" or "enclose" or "accompany." But the principle is clear. The shadow was a part of the person that survived death. The shadow could be harmed. The shadow could be stolen. The shadow could be destroyed, and if the shadow was destroyed, the person was diminished, was incomplete, was lacking something essential in the afterlife. The shadow required care. The shadow required attention. The shadow required the same seriousness that was given to the preservation of the body and the speaking of the name.

There is a funerary text, a spell from the Book of the Dead, that includes a prayer for the protection of the sheut. The dead person speaks: let my shadow not be defeated. Let my shadow not be restrained. The prayer is addressed to the gods who guard the pathways of the underworld, the gods who could, if they chose, trap the shadow, hold it, prevent it from completing the journey to the Field of Reeds. The dead person is asking for safe passage, and the safe passage is not for the body, which is in the tomb, and not for the heart, which is being weighed, and not for the ka, which is being fed. The safe passage is for the shadow. The shadow is making a journey. The shadow is traveling through the underworld on its own, navigating its own path, facing its own dangers, and the dead person, from inside the coffin, from inside the wrappings, from inside the stillness of the embalmed body, is praying for the safety of something that is, in any purely physical understanding, nothing. Is praying for the safety of an absence. Is asking the gods to protect a dark shape on the ground.

Five parts of the soul. The body, the name, the heart, the vital force, and the shadow. The shadow listed alongside the heart. The shadow given the same ontological status as the thing that is weighed against the feather of truth. The ancient Egyptians looked at the dark shape on the ground and said: this is you. This is as much you as your heart is you. This must be preserved. This must be protected. This must survive death, or you have not fully survived death, and the afterlife will be incomplete, and eternity will be spent in the condition of a person who is missing their shadow, which is the condition of a person who is missing a part of themselves.

---

This would be a curiosity if it were only the ancient Egyptians. A single culture's theology, however elaborate, however internally consistent, can be explained by local conditions. The Nile valley is bright. The sun is strong. The shadows are vivid, sharp, dramatically present in a landscape that is mostly flat and mostly pale, the sand-colored earth and the sand-colored buildings providing a surface on which shadows stand out with unusual clarity. You could argue that the ancient Egyptians elevated the shadow to a part of the soul because the shadow, in their specific environment, was especially visible, especially present, especially impossible to ignore. You could argue that the sheut was a product of Egyptian light.

But the Ashanti of what is now Ghana, living in the forest zone of West Africa, in dense vegetation, in filtered green light that is nothing like the flat bright glare of the Nile valley, arrived at the same conclusion.

The Ashanti understanding of the person included the sunsum, the spirit, and the ntoro, the inherited spiritual essence, and the mogya, the blood, and the kra, the life force. And the shadow. The Ashanti word for shadow is the same as the word for the spirit-self, the part of the person that could be affected by spiritual attack, that needed to be protected, that was vulnerable in ways that the physical body was not. If an enemy wished to harm you, one method was to harm your shadow. Step on a person's shadow with malicious intent and you were attacking the person. Capture a person's shadow, trap it, pin it, and the person would sicken. The shadow was the accessible part of the soul, the part that was out in the open, visible, touchable, on the ground, and therefore the part that was most vulnerable to anyone who wished the person ill.

There are accounts, from European missionaries and colonial administrators and later from anthropologists who came with less ideological baggage and more respect for what they were observing, of Ashanti practices related to the shadow that are precise and detailed and resistant to dismissal as primitive superstition. A person who was ill might be diagnosed as suffering from shadow-damage. The treatment would involve rituals aimed at restoring the shadow, at calling it back, at re-securing its attachment to the person. The rituals were conducted by specialists, by people whose training and expertise was specifically in the relationship between the person and the shadow, and the specialists were respected, were compensated, were consulted in the way that any medical professional is consulted, because the condition was understood to be real, the suffering was real, the remedy was specific, and the remedy sometimes worked, in the way that remedies sometimes work when the condition is real and the treatment addresses the condition and the patient believes in the treatment and the community supports the belief.

The Yoruba, in what is now Nigeria, a culture separated from the Ashanti by hundreds of miles and by significant linguistic and cultural differences, had their own understanding of the shadow as a component of the self. The Yoruba concept of the person included the ori, the spiritual head, the bearer of personal destiny, the thing that chose your fate before you were born and that carries that fate through your life. The shadow was connected to the ori. The shadow was understood as an external manifestation of the inner self, a visible sign of the invisible spiritual reality that each person carries. The shadow did not cause the destiny. The shadow reflected it. The shadow was the outward sign of the inward truth, readable, if you knew how to read it, interpretable, diagnostic.

The specifics varied between the Ashanti and the Yoruba and the dozens of other West African cultures that incorporated the shadow into their understanding of the self. The theological frameworks were different. The names were different. The rituals were different. But the underlying claim was the same: the shadow is the self, or a part of the self, or connected to the self in a way that is not merely optical. The shadow is not just the dark shape on the ground. The shadow is something that belongs to you, something that can be affected, something that matters.

These cultures had no contact with ancient Egypt. The Ashanti kingdom flourished from the seventeenth century onward. The Yoruba kingdoms were established long before European contact but had no connection to the Nile valley civilizations that produced the Book of the Dead. The convergence is independent. The conclusion is the same. The shadow is the self.

In Slavic folklore, the shadow occupies a space that is darker and stranger and more threaded with narrative menace than any of the traditions we have so far examined. The Slavic folk tradition is vast, spanning from the Czech lands to Russia, from Poland to the Balkans, and the shadow appears across this vast territory in stories that share a common structure: the shadow can be lost, and the loss of the shadow is catastrophic.

There is a story, told in different versions across Eastern Europe, of a man who sells his shadow to the devil. The details vary. In some versions the devil is a stranger at a crossroads. In others he is a well-dressed gentleman at a fair. In one version, the one that the German writer Adelbert von Chamisso turned into the novella Peter Schlemihl in 1814, the devil is a man in a gray coat who approaches the protagonist at a garden party and offers him a bottomless purse, a purse that will never run out of gold, in exchange for his shadow. The protagonist agrees. The devil kneels on the ground and peels the shadow from the earth the way you might peel a sticker from a surface, rolls it up, puts it in his pocket, and walks away. The protagonist has the gold. The protagonist does not have his shadow.

And the consequences are immediate and devastating. Not physical consequences. The man is not injured. He does not sicken. He does not weaken. The consequences are social, existential, total. People notice that he has no shadow. They recoil. Children scream. Adults stare, then look away, then refuse to speak to him. He becomes an outcast, not because of anything he has done but because of something he lacks. The absence of the shadow marks him as wrong, as incomplete, as something other than fully human. He has gold. He has health. He has everything except the dark shape on the ground, and the dark shape on the ground, it turns out, was the thing that made him acceptable, the thing that proved he was real, the thing that signaled to other people that he was one of them.

Chamisso's Peter Schlemihl is a literary work, a novella, a piece of German Romanticism, and it is easy to read it as allegory, as a story about the price of selling something essential for material gain. It is an allegory. But it is an allegory that draws its power from a belief that predates the allegory by centuries, the Slavic folk belief that the shadow is real, that the shadow matters, that a person without a shadow is a person who has lost something that cannot be compensated for by any amount of gold. The story works because the belief works. The belief works because it is not merely Slavic. It is human. It is the same belief that the ancient Egyptians expressed with the sheut and the Ashanti expressed with the sunsum and the Greeks expressed with skia. The shadow is the self. Lose the shadow, lose the self. No amount of gold is worth the dark shape on the ground.

The Aztec concept of tonalli, one of the three animating forces that constituted a person in Mesoamerican understanding, was associated with the shadow and with the sun and with personal fate. The tonalli was concentrated in the head, which is why the head was considered sacred, which is why the capture of an enemy's head in warfare was a spiritual act as well as a military one, because capturing the head was capturing the tonalli, and capturing the tonalli was capturing the person's shadow-soul, their connection to the sun, their fate. The tonalli could leave the body. It could be frightened out of a person by a sudden shock, a fall, a moment of extreme terror. When the tonalli left, the person became vulnerable, became ill, became a partial person, a person missing their shadow-soul, and the condition required treatment, required a healer, required rituals to coax the tonalli back, to re-anchor the shadow to the person, to restore the connection between the self and the sun that the shadow represented.

Children were considered especially vulnerable to tonalli loss. A child's tonalli was not yet firmly attached. A child's shadow-soul was tentative, exploratory, not yet committed to the body it inhabited. A sudden noise, a fall, a fright, could dislodge the tonalli, and the child would sicken, and the sickness was understood as shadow-sickness, as the consequence of the shadow-soul having been startled out of the body, and the treatment was to call it back, to speak to it, to coax it, to persuade the shadow to return to the child.

Across an ocean. Across a continent. Across thousands of years of independent development. The same conclusion. The shadow is the self. The shadow can be lost. The loss of the shadow is illness, is incompleteness, is a diminishment so severe that it requires treatment, requires ritual, requires the intervention of specialists who understand the relationship between the person and the dark shape on the ground. The ancient Egyptians and the Ashanti and the Yoruba and the Slavic folk traditions and the Aztecs and the Greeks all arrived at this independently, without contact, without influence, without any shared tradition. They arrived at it because they were all looking at the same thing, which was themselves, and they were all seeing the same thing, which was a dark shape on the ground that moved when they moved and stopped when they stopped and was attached to them at the feet and could not be separated from them except under conditions that felt wrong, that felt dangerous, that felt like something had been taken.

And then Peter Pan. J.M. Barrie, 1904. A play for children in which a boy's shadow becomes detached from his body and is captured by Wendy's mother and kept in a drawer, folded up, and when Peter returns for his shadow he cannot reattach it, and Wendy sews it back on with needle and thread, and the scene is played for comedy, for the delight of children in the audience who find it charming that a shadow could be folded and stored and sewn, and the children laugh, and the laughter is real, and underneath the laughter is the oldest fear in human culture, the fear that is older than any literature, older than any theology, older than any recorded thought: the fear that your shadow could be taken from you, and that if it were taken, you would not be whole.

Barrie knew what he was drawing on. He may not have known the specific traditions, the sheut, the sunsum, the tonalli, the Slavic folk tales. But he knew the feeling. He knew that the audience would understand, instinctively, without explanation, that a person without their shadow is a person in trouble. He knew that the sewing of the shadow back onto Peter's body would feel, to the audience, like a restoration, a healing, a putting-right of something that was wrong. He did not need to explain why a lost shadow was a problem. The audience already knew. Every audience, everywhere, in every culture, already knew.

In ancient Greece, the word for shadow was skia, and skia meant more than the dark shape on the ground. Skia meant the shades of the dead. Skia meant the ghosts that populated the underworld. Skia meant the insubstantial remnants of people who had once been solid, had once been real, had once been able to cast shadows of their own and now were shadows, now were the thing they used to cast, reduced to outline, to shape, to presence without substance.

The Greek underworld was not hell. It was not a place of punishment, or not primarily. The Greek underworld was a place of diminishment. The dead in Hades were not tortured, mostly. They were reduced. They were the shadows of what they had been. They retained their forms, their faces, their memories, their identities. They could be recognized. But they could not be touched. They could not be held. They could not do the things that the living do, the eating and the fighting and the loving and the sweating and the suffering that constitute a life. They existed in a state of permanent almost. Almost present. Almost real. Almost there.

Homer describes this in Book 11 of the Odyssey, the nekuia, the descent to the underworld, and the description has not lost its power in three thousand years.

Odysseus has been told by the sorceress Circe that he must consult the shade of the prophet Tiresias to learn how to get home. He must sail to the edge of the world, to the land of the Cimmerians, where the sun never shines, where the fog never lifts, where the boundary between the living and the dead is thin enough to cross. He sails there. He arrives in darkness. He digs a trench, a pit in the earth, about a cubit long and a cubit wide. He slaughters a ram and a black ewe, the blood of the animals flowing into the trench, pooling in the earth, dark and warm, the smell of it rising in the cold air of the land of the dead.

The shades come. They are drawn by the blood. They come from everywhere, from the depths of the underworld, from the fields of asphodel where the ordinary dead wander, from the places of punishment where the great sinners suffer. They come in crowds. Young women. Old men. Warriors still wearing the wounds that killed them, the armor still gashed, the blood still showing, the manner of their death still visible on their bodies even in death. They crowd around the trench. They want to drink. They need to drink. The blood is the thing that will give them substance, that will temporarily restore what death has taken from them, that will make them solid enough to speak, to remember, to be something more than shadow for a few minutes.

Odysseus holds them back with his sword. He is looking for Tiresias. He must speak to Tiresias first. The shades press forward and he holds them back and the scene is vivid and terrible, the living man with the sword and the dead pressing in from all sides, wanting the blood, needing the blood, the blood that is the only thing that can make them real again, even temporarily, even for the duration of a conversation.

Tiresias comes. Tiresias drinks. Tiresias speaks. The prophecy is given. Odysseus listens. And then, when Tiresias is finished, the other shades come forward, and among them is a face that Odysseus did not expect to see.

His mother. Anticlea. She was alive when he left for Troy. She was alive when he sailed, twenty years ago, twenty years of war and wandering and shipwreck and sorcery and the slow accumulation of distance between a man and the life he left behind. She was alive then. She is not alive now. She died while he was gone. She died, according to what she tells him when she has drunk the blood and can speak, of grief. She died of missing him. She died of the particular slow erosion that happens when the person you love does not come back and does not come back and does not come back and the waiting becomes its own kind of dying, a death that does not happen all at once but by degrees, by the gradual withdrawal of hope, by the slow sinking of the expectation that today might be the day, that the next ship might be his ship, that the next figure on the road might be him.

She tells him this. She stands on the other side of the trench, the blood having given her the temporary substance to speak, and she tells her son how she died, and her son listens, and then he does the thing that anyone would do, the thing that requires no thought, no decision, no cultural context. He reaches for her. He tries to hold her.

Three times I tried to clasp her, Homer writes, giving Odysseus the words. Three times I reached for her. And three times the shade slipped through my arms like a shadow or a dream.

Like a shadow. Homer uses the word. The comparison that Odysseus reaches for, the only comparison available to him, is the comparison to the thing he is already looking at. She is like a shadow. She is a shadow. She is the dark shape that looks like the person and has the shape of the person and cannot be held.

The first time he reaches, there is surprise. The instinct to embrace is so automatic, so deeply encoded, that the body acts before the mind can intervene, before the mind can say: she is dead, she is a shade, she is not solid. The arms extend. The arms close on nothing. The nothing is shaped like his mother but it is nothing.

The second time he reaches, there is desperation. He knows now. He knows she is not solid. He reaches anyway, because knowing is not the same as accepting, because the body does not accept what the mind knows, because the arms want to hold the thing they have held before and the arms do not understand that the thing is gone and the arms will try again because the arms are not governed by understanding, the arms are governed by love, and love does not care about the physics of the underworld.

The third time he reaches, there is understanding. Not acceptance. Understanding. The knowledge that this is how it is. The knowledge that the person who is standing in front of him, speaking to him, telling him things he needs to hear, recognizable in every detail of face and form and voice, is not reachable. Is not holdable. Is present and untouchable at the same time, which is what a shadow is, which is what a shadow has always been, which is what the dead are in the Greek understanding, which is what the dead are in every understanding: the shape without the substance. The presence without the weight. The thing that looks like the person and is not the person and will never be the person again.

Odysseus asks her why. Why can I not hold you. Why do you slip through my arms. And Anticlea answers with a description of death that is also, perfectly, a description of a shadow. This is the way it is for mortals when they die, she says. The sinews no longer hold the flesh and the bones together. The fire destroys these, the strong force of blazing fire, as soon as the life leaves the white bones, and the soul, like a dream, flutters and flies away.

Like a dream. Like a shadow. The two similes that Homer gives us for the condition of the dead, and both of them are descriptions of things that are there and not there, things that are present and insubstantial, things that can be seen but not held. The dead are shadows. The dead are dreams. The dead are the things that look like the world and dissolve when you try to touch them.

And then Achilles. The greatest warrior who ever lived, the hero of the Iliad, the man whose anger shaped the course of the Trojan War, whose grief for Patroclus was so overwhelming that it shook the foundations of the narrative, whose prowess in combat was so absolute that the gods themselves had to intervene to maintain the balance of the fighting. Achilles, the pinnacle of Greek martial excellence, the man who chose a short and glorious life over a long and obscure one, the man who was given the choice explicitly by the fates and chose glory and chose death and chose to be remembered.

Achilles is in the underworld. Achilles is a shade. Achilles drinks the blood and speaks to Odysseus, and what Achilles says is the most devastating thing that any shade says in the entire nekuia, possibly the most devastating thing that any dead person says in all of literature.

Odysseus tries to comfort him. You were the greatest of the Greeks, Odysseus says. You are honored among the dead. You rule here, among the shades.

And Achilles says: Do not try to make light of death to me. I would rather be a serf, working the land for a man of no property, a man with nothing, a man who could barely feed himself, than be king of all the perished dead.

The man who chose glory. The man who chose to be remembered. The man who chose the short and brilliant life, the life that would make him immortal in song, that would give his name to centuries, that would make him the most famous warrior in the history of a civilization that valued warriors above all other things. That man, standing in the underworld, a shade, a shadow, an outline without substance, says: I was wrong. The glory is nothing. The fame is nothing. The memory is nothing. Being a shadow is nothing. I would trade all of it, all the glory and all the fame and all the immortality in song, for the substance of the lowest life. For the weight of a body. For the ability to cast a shadow rather than be one.

This is the Greek verdict on what it means to be a shadow. It is not enough. It is the shape without the substance. It is the presence without the weight. It is everything that can be seen and nothing that can be held. And the greatest hero in Greek literature, the man whose life was the highest expression of Greek values, stands in the underworld and says: this is not enough. Being a shadow is not enough. The outline is not a life.

And the Greek language, as we have noted, does not distinguish. Skia. Shadow. Shade. Ghost. The word for the dark shape on the ground and the word for the dead are the same word. The language itself makes the claim that the essay is making. The shadow is the soul. The soul is the shadow. When you die, you do not become nothing. You become your shadow. You become the thing you used to cast. You become the outline of yourself, recognizable but insubstantial, present but unreachable, there but not there, and this is what death is, in the Greek understanding. Death is the condition of being a shadow.

Dante Alighieri arrived on the shore of Purgatory in the first light of dawn.

He had been through Hell. He had descended through the circles of the damned, from the vestibule where the uncommitted chased a blank banner in an eternal wind to the frozen lake at the center of the earth where Satan was embedded in ice, chewing on the bodies of Judas and Brutus and Cassius, the three great betrayers, the ice forming from his tears and his drool and the cold of his massive wingbeats. Dante had climbed down Satan's body, past the center of the earth, through a passage, and emerged on the other side, on the beach of Purgatory, on the island mountain that rises from the sea in the southern hemisphere, the only land in an ocean that covers half the globe.

It is dawn. The sun is rising. The air is clear for the first time since Dante entered Hell, which was dark, which was always dark, which was lit only by fire and by the pallid glow of suffering. Here on the beach the air is different. The sky is different. Dante looks up and sees stars he has never seen, the stars of the southern hemisphere, and the light is gentle, and the sea is calm, and Virgil is beside him, Virgil who has guided him through Hell, Virgil who is himself a shade, a dead poet, a shadow, and who will guide Dante up the mountain of Purgatory until the point, near the summit, where a shade can go no further and a living man must continue alone.

The sun rises higher. The light strengthens. And Dante, standing on the beach, casts a shadow.

Dante is very specific about this, because Dante is very specific about everything, because specificity is his method, because the Commedia is a poem built from details so precise that scholars have used them to calculate the date and time of the fictional journey, have used the positions of the stars Dante describes to determine that the poem begins on the evening of Good Friday, April 7 or 8, 1300, and proceeds through the days that follow. Dante tells you where the sun is. Dante tells you the angle of the light. Dante tells you the color of the sky. And Dante tells you that his shadow falls on the ground in front of him, stretching to the west, because the sun is in the east, because it is morning, because the light is low and the shadows are long.

The souls on the beach notice. They notice the shadow before they notice the man. They are approaching in a boat, a vessel guided by an angel, bringing the newly dead to the shores of Purgatory, and as they disembark and begin to move along the beach they see, on the ground, a shadow. One shadow where there should be none. Because they cast no shadows. They are dead. They are immaterial. Light passes through them the way light passes through clear water. They walk in the sun and the ground beneath them is uniformly lit. They produce no darkness. They leave no mark. And here, on the beach, a dark shape on the ground. A shadow. A shape that only a body can produce. A shape that only the living can cast.

They stop. They stare. Canto III of the Purgatorio, and the souls of the dead are staring at a shadow on the ground, and their staring is the recognition that a living man is among them, and the recognition is conveyed entirely through shadow. Not through the sight of Dante's face. Not through the sound of his voice. Not through his breathing, his warmth, his color. Through his shadow. The shadow is the sign. The shadow is the proof. The shadow is the thing that the dead cannot produce and that the living cannot avoid producing, and the difference between being alive and being dead is, in this passage, the difference between casting a shadow and not casting one.

Dante draws attention to this repeatedly throughout the Purgatorio. When he climbs the mountain, his shadow falls on the cliff face and the souls notice. When he walks in sunlight, his shadow moves on the ground and the souls remark on it. He is conspicuous among the dead not because of his vitality, not because of his color, not because of any positive quality of aliveness, but because of his shadow. Because of the darkness he produces. Because of the absence he creates on the ground. Aliveness, in the Purgatorio, is measured not by what you have but by what you block. To be alive is to be opaque. To be alive is to stand between the light and the earth and prevent the light from reaching the earth. To be alive is to make a shadow.

The dead in Dante's Purgatory are not diminished in the way that Homer's shades are diminished. They speak fluently. They think clearly. They feel deeply. They weep, they sing, they argue, they remember, they repent. They are fully realized souls in every respect except one. They are transparent. The light goes through them. They leave no darkness on the ground. They are present without being opaque. They exist without blocking anything. They are, in the most literal physical sense, immaterial, and the sign of their immateriality is the absence of a shadow, and Dante, the living man, walking among them with his shadow stretching out behind him on the stone terrace of the mountain, is a constant reminder of what they have lost. Not their minds. Not their hearts. Not their voices. Their opacity. Their ability to get in the way of light. Their capacity, the most basic physical capacity of any material object, to block.

There is a performance tradition that is older than writing.

It is older than the Iliad, which was composed sometime around the eighth century BCE and which describes events that, if they happened at all, happened centuries before the composition. It is older than the earliest Egyptian tomb paintings, which date to the fourth millennium BCE and which depict a culture already ancient, already complex, already in possession of a theology that had been developing for longer than anyone could remember. It is, in all likelihood, older than the cave paintings at Lascaux and Chauvet, which date to tens of thousands of years ago and which may themselves be a form of shadow art, if the contested theory of shadow-tracing is correct.

The performance tradition is shadow puppetry, and it exists, in one form or another, on every continent where human beings have lived long enough to develop a culture, which is every continent.

In Java, on a night in the dry season, when the air is warm and still and the village has gathered, the dalang begins.

The screen is a white cotton cloth, stretched taut between two poles, lit from behind by a coconut oil lamp. The lamp is a brass dish filled with oil, a wick of twisted cotton, the flame steady in the windless air, casting a light that is warm and golden and not very bright, bright enough to throw shadows but not bright enough to illuminate the audience, who sit on the shadow side of the screen in a darkness that is part of the experience, a darkness that separates them from the lit world of the puppets the way the edge of a stage separates the audience from the actors, except that here the separation is more total, more complete, because the audience is in the dark and the story is in the light and the boundary between them is the screen, the cloth, the surface on which the shadows fall.

The dalang sits behind the screen, cross-legged, surrounded by the puppets. The puppets are made of buffalo hide, cured and dried and then carved with a level of detail that the audience will never see, because the audience sees only the shadow, only the silhouette, only the outline of the figure against the lit cloth. The puppets are painted in brilliant colors, reds and golds and blues and greens, and the colors are for the dalang and for the gods, not for the audience. The audience sees black shapes on white cloth. The audience sees shadows.

The dalang picks up a puppet. Holds it against the cloth. The shadow appears on the screen, sharp, articulated, the perforations in the hide creating patterns of light within the shadow, the body of the figure decorated with tiny points of brightness, stars within the darkness, the shadow itself containing light. The dalang moves the puppet's arms, its head. The shadow moves. The shadow is alive.

And the dalang speaks. The dalang gives the shadow a voice. The dalang speaks for Arjuna, the great warrior, and the voice is noble and measured. The dalang speaks for Duryodhana, the villain, and the voice is harsh and proud. The dalang speaks for the panakawan, the clown servants, and the voice is broad and comic and earthy and the audience laughs, the children laugh, the old men laugh, the women nursing babies laugh, because the clowns in wayang kulit are genuinely funny, are funny in the way that only characters who have been refined by a thousand years of performance can be funny, every joke tested and polished and perfected across generations of dalang passing the tradition to their apprentices. The dalang speaks for the gods and the voice changes again, becomes something other than human, something larger, and the shadow on the screen is a god now, and the audience is watching a god, a shadow god, a god made of the absence of light on a cotton screen, and the audience feels something, and what the audience feels is awe, and the awe is real, and the awe has been real for a thousand years.

The performance lasts all night. From sunset to sunrise. Eight, nine, ten hours. The dalang does not rest. The dalang does not stop. The dalang is performing the Mahabharata, the great epic, the story of the Pandava brothers and their war against their cousins, the story that contains within it every human emotion and every human situation and the Bhagavad Gita, the moment when Arjuna falters on the battlefield and Krishna reveals the nature of duty and of God, and this story is told in shadow, on a screen, by one man with a lamp and a collection of leather figures, and the audience sits in the dark for the entire night, and the audience does not leave, and the audience is moved, deeply and genuinely moved, by the shapes on the cloth, and the shapes on the cloth are nothing. Are absence. Are the pattern of light that the leather figures block.

In the Chinese tradition, shadow puppetry is at least two thousand years old and carries, in one of its origin stories, the weight of grief. Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty, who ruled from 141 to 87 BCE, lost a concubine to illness. The historical sources, sparse and fragmentary and filtered through centuries of retelling, say that her name was Lady Li, and that the emperor loved her, and that her death devastated him, and that his grief was the kind that does not diminish with time but hardens, calcifies, becomes a permanent feature of the interior landscape, a grief so total that it alters the shape of the life that contains it.

A court advisor, or a shaman, or a magician, depending on which source you follow, approached the emperor with an offer. He could summon the spirit of Lady Li. He could make her visible again. The emperor agreed, because the emperor would have agreed to anything, because grief of that magnitude does not evaluate offers rationally, does not weigh risks, does not consider the possibility that the offer is a trick or a performance or a kindness dressed as magic. The emperor wanted to see her. The emperor would pay any price to see her.

The magician fashioned a figure. Donkey leather, or perhaps paper, or perhaps cloth, the sources disagree and the disagreement does not matter. The magician set up a screen. A cloth, stretched between poles. A lamp behind the screen. The magician held the figure between the lamp and the cloth, and the figure's shadow fell on the screen, and the emperor, sitting on the other side, in the dark, in the audience, saw the shadow.

Did he believe it was her? The sources are ambiguous. Some say he was comforted. Some say he wept. Some say he reached for the shadow, the way Odysseus reached for Anticlea, the way anyone reaches for the shape of someone they have lost. He reached and the shadow was on the cloth and the cloth was between them and the shadow could not be touched and the emperor sat in the dark and looked at the shadow of a woman who was not there and was moved, was moved by the absence, was moved by the shape without the substance, was moved the way that every person who has ever looked at a silhouette of the dead or a photograph of the dead or a shadow of the dead has been moved, which is to say: completely, and without the movement being diminished by the knowledge that the thing being looked at is not the person but the shadow of the person.

The origin of Chinese shadow puppetry, in this telling, is the same as the origin of the silhouette portrait. Grief. The desire to see the dead. The willingness to accept the outline, the shape, the shadow, as sufficient. The emperor knew it was a shadow. The widow with the silhouette in her locket knew it was a paper cutout. The mother scrolling through photographs on her phone knows they are patterns of light on a screen. The knowledge does not reduce the feeling. The feeling does not require the substance. The shadow is enough.

In India, tolpavakoothu, shadow puppetry from Kerala, uses figures that are enormous, up to four feet tall, the shadows filling a massive screen in performances that take place in special theaters attached to temples, the stories sacred, the performances ritual, the shadow play a form of worship. In Turkey and Greece, the Karagöz tradition operates in a different register entirely, comic rather than sacred, the central figure a trickster, a fool, a shadow who says what the living cannot say. Karagöz mocks the powerful. Karagöz breaks rules. Karagöz exists in the shadow space where the constraints of the lit world do not apply, where the things that cannot be spoken aloud can be spoken by a shadow on a screen, because the shadow is not quite real and therefore not quite accountable, and the audience laughs at things they could not laugh at if a living person said them, because the living person would be punished and the shadow cannot be punished, because how do you punish a shadow, how do you imprison an absence, how do you hold accountable a thing that does not exist.

In all of these traditions, across all of these cultures, across thousands of years and thousands of miles, the same thing happens. An audience sits in the dark. A screen is lit. Shadows move on the screen. The audience watches the shadows and feels things. Real things. Deep things. The audience weeps at the death of Arjuna's son in the wayang kulit. The audience laughs at Karagöz's insults. The audience is moved by the shape of Lady Li on the emperor's screen. The feelings are real. The shadows are not.

This is the fact about shadows that the modern world has the most difficulty accepting. The shadow is enough. The outline is enough. The shape is enough. The absence carries the meaning. The minimum visual information, a silhouette on a screen, is sufficient to trigger the full range of human emotional response, from grief to joy to terror to awe, and the emotional response is not diminished by the absence of detail, is not reduced by the lack of resolution, is not weakened by the knowledge that what you are watching is nothing, is the shape of light that a piece of leather blocks.

The brain does not need resolution. The brain needs shape. The brain needs movement. The brain needs story. Give it these three things, even in the most minimal form, even as nothing more than a shadow on a cloth, and the brain will do the rest. The brain will fill in the detail. The brain will add the color, the texture, the face, the expression. The brain will construct, from the barest outline, a complete experience, and the experience will be as real, as emotionally vivid, as neurologically complete as the experience of watching a high-definition film on a screen the size of a wall. The shadow puppet and the IMAX movie activate the same neural pathways. The dalang with his lamp and leather and the Hollywood studio with its hundreds of millions of dollars are doing the same thing. They are projecting shapes and the shapes are telling stories and the stories are making people feel things and the people are feeling the things and the feelings are real.

The shadow is not a diminished version of reality. The shadow is reality compressed to its essential geometry. And the essential geometry is enough.

And then Nosferatu.

F.W. Murnau, 1922. An unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, the names changed, the locations shifted, the legal maneuvering ultimately unsuccessful, the Stoker estate winning a judgment that ordered all copies of the film destroyed. The copies were not all destroyed. Some survived. And what survived was an image that has outlasted both the legal dispute and the novel it was based on, an image that has become the single most iconic visual in the history of horror cinema, an image that has been referenced and reproduced thousands of times across a hundred years, an image that is, when you see it, immediately recognizable even if you have never seen the film, even if you have never heard of the film, because the image has entered the visual unconscious of the culture and become a permanent resident there.

The image is not of the vampire. The image is of the vampire's shadow.

Count Orlok, ascending a staircase. The camera does not show Orlok. The camera shows the wall beside the staircase, a bare white wall, and on the wall is Orlok's shadow. The shadow is climbing. The shadow is enormous, distorted by the angle of the light source, the proportions wrong in the way that shadows make proportions wrong. The head is too large, too round, bald. The ears are pointed, bat-like, projecting from the skull at angles that suggest something other than human anatomy. The shoulders are hunched. The body is impossibly thin, impossibly tall, the torso elongated by the geometry of projection. And the hands. The fingers are long, impossibly long, thin as sticks, curved into claws, the fingers of something that grasps, that seizes, that takes. The shadow reaches toward the top of the stairs. The shadow reaches toward the door behind which Ellen, the victim, the woman who will ultimately sacrifice herself to destroy the vampire, is lying in bed. The shadow hand extends across the wall. The shadow hand extends across the door. The shadow hand closes, the fingers curling inward, and Ellen's heart, shown in close-up, begins to beat faster, the shadow touching her through the door, through the wall, through the boundary that is supposed to protect her.

The shadow is more frightening than the vampire. This is the point. This is what Murnau understood, what the dalang understood, what every shadow puppeteer in every culture understood: the shadow is the concentrated version. The shadow is the shape without the detail, and the shape without the detail is more powerful than the shape with the detail, because the detail limits. The detail defines. The detail says: this is what the thing looks like. And once you know what the thing looks like, the thing is bounded, is finite, is comprehensible, is something you can categorize and therefore something you can manage. The shadow refuses to be categorized. The shadow says: this is the shape. Fill in the rest yourself. And you fill in the rest with whatever you are most afraid of, and what you are most afraid of is always worse than what someone else can show you, because your fear is calibrated to you, is specific to your particular anxieties, your particular night terrors, your particular history of things that frightened you as a child and things that frighten you now and things that you do not admit frighten you but that your body knows, your body remembers, your body responds to when the shadow's hand extends across the wall and closes.

The scene is silent. The film is from 1922, before synchronized sound. There is no soundtrack, or rather the soundtrack is whatever the theater organ played, which varied from screening to screening, which means the scene exists in a kind of auditory void, the shadow climbing in silence, the hand reaching in silence, the fingers closing in silence. And the silence is part of it. Sound is information. Sound tells you what is happening, where it is happening, how fast it is approaching. Silence tells you nothing. Silence is the auditory equivalent of shadow, the absence of information, and the absence of information is the space where fear expands to fill the available volume, because fear is a gas, fear expands to fill the container, and silence is the largest container.

Nosferatu's shadow climbing the stairs is the silhouette portrait inverted. The silhouette portrait was the outline of someone loved, kept in a locket, sufficient for grief. Nosferatu's shadow is the outline of something feared, projected on a wall, sufficient for terror. The mechanism is the same. The candle and the nuclear flash and the coconut oil lamp and the film projector are all doing the same thing, which is casting a shadow on a surface, and the shadow on the surface is carrying meaning, and the meaning is real, and the meaning does not require substance.

Plato would disagree. Or at least, Plato is usually understood to disagree.

The allegory of the cave, in Book VII of the Republic, is the most famous passage about shadows in the history of Western philosophy, and it is usually read as a condemnation. Shadows are illusions. Shadows are the lowest form of reality. People who mistake shadows for the real thing are prisoners, chained, deluded, living in a cave of false understanding, seeing reflections of reflections and believing they see the world.

The setup. Prisoners in a cave, chained since birth, unable to turn their heads. They face a wall. Behind them, higher up, a fire. Between the fire and the prisoners, a low wall, like the screen in a puppet show. Behind the low wall, people carrying objects, figures, statues of animals and humans and things, the objects extending above the low wall, and the fire casting the shadows of these objects onto the wall that the prisoners face. The prisoners see only the shadows. The shadows are all they have ever seen. They name the shadows. They discuss the shadows. They become experts in the shadows, predicting which shadow will follow which, developing theories about the shadows' behavior, constructing an entire system of knowledge from the shapes on the wall.

Plato describes this as imprisonment. The prisoners are chained. They are captives. Their entire experience of reality is false, is indirect, is a shadow play that they mistake for the world. The philosopher is the prisoner who is freed, who turns around, who sees the fire and the objects and eventually, after a painful ascent into the light, the sun itself, the source of all illumination, the Form of the Good, the ultimate reality of which everything in the cave is a dim and distorted copy.

The standard reading: the shadows are bad. The cave is ignorance. The sun is truth. The philosopher's job is to escape the shadows and reach the light.

But notice what the prisoners are actually doing. They are watching a shadow puppet performance. Plato describes the setup with precision, and the setup is wayang kulit. A light source behind a screen. Objects between the light and the screen. Shadows projected onto a surface. An audience watching. The prisoners are not passive receivers of illusion. They are active interpreters. They name the shadows. They theorize about the shadows. They build knowledge from the shadows. They are doing what every audience in every shadow puppet theater has ever done, which is engage with the shapes on the screen, make meaning from them, build understanding from the patterns they observe.

And when the freed prisoner escapes the cave and sees the sun, what happens? The sun blinds him. Plato is explicit about this. The prisoner's eyes are in agony. The light is unbearable. He cannot look at it. He wants to go back to the cave, wants to return to the shadows, because the shadows did not hurt and the light does. He does not go from shadow to sun in a single liberating moment of clarity. He goes through stages. First he looks at shadows of real things. Then at reflections in water. Then at the things themselves. Then at the night sky. Then, finally, at the sun. The progression is from shadow to substance, from indirect to direct, from the easiest form of perception to the hardest.

The shadow is where you start. Plato intends this as a description of a process that moves from worse to better, from illusion to reality, from shadow to sun. But notice what it also says: the shadow is the accessible form. The shadow is the form that the human eye can tolerate, the form that does not cause pain, the form in which information about reality first becomes available to the human perceptual system. The sun is the source, but the sun is also blinding, also painful, also destructive to the instrument that tries to observe it. The shadow is the safe translation. The shadow is the mediated version, the version you can look at without being burned.

This is what Eratosthenes understood. You cannot look at the sun to determine its position. The sun punishes direct observation. But you can look at the shadow, and the shadow tells you where the sun is. This is what the doctor understands. You cannot look inside the body directly. But you can look at the X-ray, which is a shadow of the body's interior, and the shadow tells you what is inside.

A CT scan is Plato's cave in reverse. The CT scanner takes shadow images of the body from every angle, hundreds of projections, hundreds of patterns of light and dark, and from these shadows a computer reconstructs the three-dimensional structure that produced them. The computer starts with shadows and builds reality. The computer does what Plato said was the wrong direction, what Plato said was the direction of illusion rather than truth. The computer moves from shadow to substance, from projection to object, from the shapes on the wall to the thing that cast them, and the reconstruction is accurate, is clinically useful, saves lives.

Eratosthenes read a shadow and derived the circumference of the earth. Thales read a shadow and derived the height of the pyramid. The radiologist reads a shadow and derives the location of a tumor. In every case the direction of inference is the same: from shadow to reality. From absence to presence. From the pattern on the surface to the thing that cast the pattern. In every case the inference is valid. In every case the shadow carries true information about the thing it represents. In every case the prisoners in the cave, if they were better at reading shadows, could derive real knowledge about the objects casting them.

Plato's prisoners were not wrong to attend to the shadows. They were wrong only in thinking that the shadows were all there was. The shadow is not the whole truth. But the shadow is not a lie, either. The shadow is a translation, a coded version of reality, a compressed representation that carries real information in a form that the human perceptual system can process without being destroyed. The sun is the source. The shadow is the message. And shooting the messenger, which is what the standard reading of Plato's cave amounts to, does not change the fact that the message is real.
