## V. MASS

A total solar eclipse is not what you think it is. You have seen photographs. You have seen the black disc of the moon centered in the white corona, the wispy tendrils of superheated plasma extending outward like the petals of a flower, the sky dark, the effect dramatic. You have seen this image and you think you know what an eclipse looks like, the way you think you know what the Grand Canyon looks like because you have seen photographs of the Grand Canyon, and then you go to the Grand Canyon and you stand at the rim and the photograph was a lie. Not a lie of content but a lie of scale. The photograph showed you what the thing looks like. The photograph did not show you what the thing is.

A total solar eclipse is the moon's shadow falling on you.

This is worth saying plainly, because the experience of an eclipse is so overwhelming, so total in its strangeness, that the physics of it tends to get lost in the spectacle. The physics is simple. The moon passes between the earth and the sun. The moon blocks the sun's light. The moon's shadow falls on the earth's surface and sweeps across it at roughly 1,700 kilometers per hour, which is the speed of the moon's orbital motion projected onto the surface of the rotating earth, and if you are standing in the path of that shadow, the shadow passes over you, and for a few minutes, typically between two and seven minutes depending on the geometry of the particular eclipse, you are in the moon's umbra.

The umbra. The full shadow. The region of complete blockage. The region where the light source is entirely hidden by the obstacle, where not a single photon from the sun's surface reaches you, where the sun is gone, completely, behind the disc of the moon, and the sky is dark and the stars come out and the temperature drops and the birds stop singing.

The birds stop singing. This is the detail that people mention first when they describe their first total eclipse, before the corona, before the darkness, before the diamond ring effect, before any of the visual phenomena that the photographs prepare you for. The birds stop singing. The birds interpret the sudden darkness as nightfall. The circadian response is instantaneous. The birds go silent. The crickets begin. The roosters, if there are roosters nearby, crow, because the roosters interpret the return of light at the end of totality as dawn, and they crow at dawn, and they do not know that dawn was a few hours ago, and the crowing of a rooster at two in the afternoon while the sun reappears from behind the moon is one of the stranger experiences available to a person standing on the surface of the earth.

The temperature drops. This is not subtle. In the minutes leading up to totality, as the moon progressively covers the sun, the light diminishes gradually, and you might not notice, because the human eye adjusts, because the eye is extraordinarily good at compensating for changes in illumination, which is why you do not notice the light fading until it has faded significantly, until the quality of the light has changed in a way that is difficult to describe and impossible to mistake. The light becomes thin. The light becomes metallic. The shadows on the ground sharpen, because the sun, which is normally a disc, has been reduced to a crescent, and a crescent sun casts sharper shadows than a full disc, the way a point source of light casts sharper shadows than an extended source, because the penumbra narrows as the source narrows. The shadows of leaves on the ground become pinhole projections of the crescent sun, hundreds of tiny crescents dappling the sidewalk, each one a miniature image of the partially eclipsed sun, each one formed by the gap between the leaves acting as a pinhole camera. The ground is covered in tiny suns being eaten by tiny moons. Nobody warned you about this. The photographs did not show this. The photographs showed the sky. The ground is where the strange thing is happening.

And then totality. The last sliver of sunlight vanishes behind the moon's limb and the corona appears, not gradually, not fading in, but instantly, as though someone has flipped a switch, as though the corona was always there and the sun's brightness was hiding it, which is exactly what was happening. The corona is always there. The corona is the sun's outer atmosphere, a region of superheated plasma extending millions of kilometers into space, hotter than the sun's surface by a factor of several hundred, a fact that has puzzled solar physicists for decades and remains not fully explained, and the corona is always there, always glowing, always radiating, and you cannot see it because the sun is too bright, because the sun's surface outshines the corona by a factor of a million, because the thing you are trying to see is hidden by the brightness of the thing it surrounds.

The moon hides the brightness. The shadow removes the obstacle. The eclipse is a shadow that reveals by hiding. The moon's shadow falls on the earth and in that shadow the sun's surface disappears and the corona appears and the thing that was invisible because of the light becomes visible because of the darkness and the seeing is made possible by the not-seeing and the revelation is a consequence of the obscuring. This is backwards. This is the opposite of how revelation is supposed to work. Revelation is supposed to involve more light, not less. Revelation is supposed to involve removing the darkness, not adding it. The eclipse reverses this. The eclipse says: the darkness is the instrument of seeing. The shadow is how you find what the light is hiding.

The corona is scientifically important. It is the region where the solar wind originates, the stream of charged particles that flows outward from the sun and fills the solar system and interacts with the earth's magnetic field and produces the aurora borealis and occasionally disrupts power grids and satellite communications and reminds the species that lives on the third planet from the sun that it lives in the atmosphere of a star. The corona is also the region where coronal mass ejections originate, enormous eruptions of magnetized plasma that are the most energetic events in the solar system short of the sun's own nuclear reactions, and that can, when directed at the earth, cause geomagnetic storms of the kind that in 1859, the Carrington Event, induced electrical currents in telegraph wires strong enough to shock operators and set telegraph paper on fire and produced aurora visible as far south as the Caribbean.

For most of human history, the only way to study the corona was during a total eclipse. The only way to see the thing was to wait for the shadow. Scientists traveled the world chasing eclipses, mounting expeditions to remote locations where the path of totality would cross, shipping telescopes and spectrographs and photographic plates to deserts and mountaintops and islands, hoping for clear skies, knowing that a single cloud at the wrong moment would waste years of planning and thousands of miles of travel. The history of solar physics in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is substantially a history of eclipse expeditions, of scientists following the moon's shadow across the surface of the earth, setting up their instruments in the shadow, making their observations in the few minutes of totality, and then packing up and waiting for the next eclipse, sometimes years later, sometimes on the other side of the planet.

Arthur Eddington's 1919 expedition to Príncipe, a small island off the coast of West Africa, was one such expedition, and it changed physics. Eddington was there to test Einstein's general theory of relativity, which predicted that the gravitational field of a massive object would bend the path of light passing near it. The sun's gravity, Einstein said, would deflect the light from distant stars, bending their apparent positions, shifting them slightly outward from the sun's disc. The effect was small. The deflection was tiny, on the order of arcseconds, barely detectable with the instruments of the time. And the only way to measure it was during a total eclipse, because the only way to see the stars near the sun was when the sun's brightness was hidden by the moon's shadow.

Eddington took photographs of the star field near the sun during totality and compared them to photographs of the same star field taken months earlier when the sun was elsewhere in the sky. The stars had shifted. Their positions were displaced, bent by the sun's gravity, by exactly the amount that Einstein's theory predicted. The light from distant stars, traveling across billions of kilometers of space, had been deflected by the curvature of spacetime around the sun, and the deflection was measured in the moon's shadow, on a small island in the Atlantic, by a man with a camera and a telescope who had traveled there for the specific purpose of reading the darkness.

The shadow revealed the curvature of spacetime. The shadow was the instrument. The moon blocked the sun and in the blocking made visible something that had never been seen before and that confirmed a theory that would restructure the human understanding of the universe. The revelation was in the shadow. The truth was in the darkness. The cosmos disclosed its geometry in the brief minutes when the moon's shadow fell on Príncipe and a man with a photographic plate captured the bending of starlight.

Every total eclipse is a shadow event. Every total eclipse is the experience of standing in the umbra of the moon, the full shadow, the region of complete blockage, and experiencing what it means to be in total shadow, which is to say: the stars come out and the temperature drops and the birds stop singing and the corona blazes and the sky is the color of deep twilight and the horizon in every direction glows with the colors of sunset, a 360-degree sunset, because you are standing in a shadow that is roughly 160 kilometers wide and outside the shadow in every direction the sun is still shining and the light from the lit world leaks around the edges of the shadow and paints the horizon in oranges and pinks and reds, and you are standing in the center of this, in the dark center of a circle of light, in the umbra, and the experience is not like anything else that happens on this planet.

People weep. People who are not prone to weeping, who have not wept in years, who consider themselves composed and rational and not given to displays of emotion, stand in the shadow of the moon and weep. The reaction is involuntary. The reaction is pre-rational. The reaction is the body responding to a set of stimuli that the body has no framework for processing, because the body has never experienced this, because the body evolved under conditions where the sun is either up or down and the transition between the two is gradual, takes minutes, is preceded by the slow dimming of the evening, and what is happening during a total eclipse is not gradual, is not slow, is the sun being there and then not being there and then being there again, and the body does not know what to do with this, and what the body does is weep.

There have been roughly 70 total solar eclipses visible from some part of the earth's surface during a typical human lifetime. Most occur over ocean, where no one sees them. The moon's shadow sweeps across the water and nobody is there and the shadow passes and the fish do not care and the ocean does not remember. For any given location on the earth's surface, a total solar eclipse occurs roughly once every 375 years, which means that for most of human history, most people never saw one. A total eclipse was a once-in-a-civilization event for any particular place. If you saw one, you saw something that nobody in your community had ever seen, that nobody's grandparents had seen, that nobody's grandparents' grandparents had seen. You had no framework. You had no preparation. The sun went out. The sky went dark. The stars appeared at midday. The birds went silent. The air turned cold. And then, after a few minutes, the sun came back.

The historical records of eclipses are records of terror. Chinese records from as early as 2136 BCE describe eclipses as attacks on the sun by a celestial dragon. Drums were beaten. Arrows were fired into the sky. The purpose was to frighten the dragon, to drive it away from the sun, to rescue the light from the darkness that was consuming it. The Babylonians, who were better astronomers, learned to predict eclipses, but prediction did not eliminate the dread. A predicted eclipse was still an eclipse. Knowing it was coming did not change what it felt like when it arrived. The Norse believed that the wolf Sköll, who chased the sun across the sky every day, had finally caught it. The Hindu mythology attributed eclipses to the demon Rahu, who had stolen a sip of the nectar of immortality and been beheaded by Vishnu, but whose head, now immortal, periodically swallowed the sun, the sun passing through the severed neck and re-emerging, because Rahu had no body to contain it.

Every culture that experienced an eclipse reached for the same explanation: something is eating the sun. Something is swallowing it. Something alive and hungry and dark has attacked the source of light. The explanation is wrong in its specifics and correct in its structure. Something is eating the sun. The moon is eating the sun. The moon is passing in front of the sun and consuming its light, progressively, crescent by crescent, bite by bite, until the sun is gone, until only the corona remains, the halo, the last glow around the dark disc, and then the moon moves on and the sun returns and the dragon has been defeated and the wolf has been driven off and Rahu's severed head has released its prey.

The light from a distant galaxy reaches the earth after traveling for billions of years across the expanding universe. The light left its source when the universe was young, when the galaxy that produced it was young, when the stars in the galaxy were among the first stars, burning hot and blue and fast, spending their hydrogen with the profligacy of things that do not know they will run out. The light traveled outward in all directions, a sphere of photons expanding at the speed of light, crossing empty space, passing through the voids between galaxy clusters, passing through regions where there was nothing, nothing for millions of light-years, and then approaching the vicinity of a massive object, a galaxy cluster, a concentration of matter so vast and so dense that its gravitational field distorts the spacetime around it the way a bowling ball distorts a rubber sheet, and the light, traveling through this distorted spacetime, bends.

The light bends because spacetime bends. This is the central insight of general relativity, the insight that Eddington confirmed in the moon's shadow on Príncipe. Mass distorts the geometry of space and time. A massive object creates a curvature in the fabric of spacetime itself, and anything moving through that curved spacetime follows the curvature, follows the bend, follows the geometry. Light follows the geometry. Light is not exempt. Light has no mass but light follows spacetime, and spacetime is curved around massive objects, and therefore light curves around massive objects.

When the light from a distant source passes near a massive object on its way to us, the massive object acts as a lens. Not a glass lens, not a lens made of material, but a gravitational lens, a lens made of curved spacetime, a lens whose focusing power is determined not by the shape of glass but by the distribution of mass. The gravitational lens bends the light from the distant source, redirects it, focuses it, and the result, if the alignment is right, if the source and the lens and the observer are sufficiently close to a straight line, is an image. A distorted image. A smeared image. An image that has been stretched and bent and sometimes multiplied by the curvature, the distant galaxy appearing as an arc, or a ring, or multiple copies of itself arranged around the lensing mass.

The most spectacular form of this is the Einstein ring. When the source, the lens, and the observer are perfectly aligned, the light from the source is bent equally in all directions by the lens, and the image of the source is spread into a complete ring around the lensing mass. A ring of light surrounding a dark center. A halo of the distant galaxy wrapped around the near one. The distant galaxy is behind the near one. The distant galaxy should be invisible, should be blocked, should be in the near galaxy's shadow. But the gravitational lens bends the light around the obstruction, brings the light from behind the obstacle to the observer, reveals the hidden thing by bending light around the thing that hides it.

This is, again, a shadow revealing something that the light alone could not. The gravitational lens is not a shadow in the traditional sense, but the principle is the same: an object between the source and the observer interacts with the light, and the interaction produces an image that contains information about both the intervening object and the distant source. The shape of the Einstein ring tells you the mass of the lensing galaxy. The distortion of the arc tells you the distribution of matter in the lens. The image of the distant source, smeared and stretched and bent, tells you something about the source itself, something about its shape and brightness, something that you could not know without the lens, without the intervening mass, without the obstacle that bent the light and in the bending revealed what would otherwise have been invisible.

Astronomers use gravitational lensing to study the most distant objects in the universe. The lens amplifies. The lens magnifies. A galaxy that would be too faint to detect directly becomes detectable when a massive galaxy cluster between it and the earth bends and focuses its light, concentrating it, brightening it, making the invisible visible. The intervening mass, which is in one sense an obstacle, a thing in the way, a thing that distorts the image, is in another sense an instrument, a telescope made of gravity, a shadow that illuminates what it falls upon.

On September 14, 2015, at 5:51 in the morning Eastern Time, the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, one in Hanford, Washington, and one in Livingston, Louisiana, simultaneously recorded a signal.

The signal lasted two-tenths of a second. In those two-tenths of a second, the signal swept upward in frequency and amplitude, rising from 35 hertz to 250 hertz, a chirp, a rising tone, the frequency increasing as the amplitude increased, the whole thing over so quickly that if it had been audible, if it had been sound rather than gravitational radiation, it would have been a brief upward swoop, a fraction of a second of something that sounded like a bird call or a whistle or the noise a small animal makes when it is startled.

The signal was not sound. The signal was a gravitational wave, a ripple in the fabric of spacetime itself, a distortion that propagated outward from its source at the speed of light and arrived at the earth after traveling for 1.3 billion years, the wave weakening as it spread, diluting itself across an expanding sphere of spacetime, arriving at the earth so attenuated, so faint, so extraordinarily diminished by the distance it had traveled that the distortion it produced in the four-kilometer arms of the LIGO detectors was approximately one-thousandth the diameter of a proton. One-thousandth the diameter of a proton. The arms of the detector, four kilometers long, were stretched and compressed by a distance smaller than the nucleus of an atom, and the detector detected it.

The source of the signal was the merger of two black holes, 1.3 billion light-years away, each roughly thirty times the mass of the sun, orbiting each other in a death spiral that had been tightening for millions of years, the two black holes drawing closer and closer, orbiting faster and faster, the gravitational radiation carrying away energy, the energy loss causing the orbit to decay, the orbit decaying causing the black holes to draw closer, the closer proximity causing them to orbit faster, the faster orbit causing more gravitational radiation, the cycle accelerating, the frequency of the orbit increasing, the two objects spiraling inward until, in the final fraction of a second, they merged, the two black holes becoming one black hole, the merger releasing more energy than all the stars in the observable universe were producing at that moment, the energy released not as light, not as heat, not as radiation of any kind that any telescope could detect, but as gravitational waves, as ripples in spacetime, as a distortion that spread outward in all directions and arrived at the earth 1.3 billion years later and stretched a four-kilometer tube by one-thousandth the width of a proton.

This is shadow detection. This is the gnomon's method applied at the largest scale in the universe.

The black holes that merged were invisible. They were black holes. They emitted no light. They could not be seen directly by any telescope at any wavelength. They were, by definition, dark, objects so massive and so compact that their gravitational field prevented even light from escaping, that their event horizons were the boundaries beyond which nothing, not light, not information, not any signal of any kind, could reach the outside universe. They were the darkest objects in the cosmos. They were absences, holes in the fabric of the visible universe, regions where matter had collapsed to a density so extreme that it had torn a hole in spacetime and everything that fell into the hole was gone, permanently, irretrievably gone from the observable universe.

And yet we detected them. We detected them by their shadow on spacetime. The gravitational waves that LIGO recorded were not produced by the black holes in the way that light is produced by a star. They were produced by the distortion that the black holes created in the spacetime around them, the rippling of the fabric, the trembling of the geometry, the shadow that two invisible objects cast on the medium they were embedded in. The gravitational wave is the shadow of the merger. The signal in the detector is the outline of two objects that cannot be seen, traced in the distortion they created, the way the gnomon traces the sun's position by the shadow it casts on the ground. We did not see the black holes. We saw their effect. We saw the mark they made on spacetime. We saw their shadow.

The detection method is a direct descendant of the method that Eratosthenes used. You cannot observe the thing directly. The thing is too far, too dark, too dangerous, too inaccessible. But the thing interacts with the medium around it, and the interaction leaves a trace, and the trace is detectable, and from the trace you can infer the thing. Eratosthenes could not measure the earth directly. He measured its shadow. LIGO cannot detect black holes directly. LIGO detects their shadow on spacetime.

The sensitivity required to do this is almost impossible to comprehend. One-thousandth the diameter of a proton. The LIGO detectors are the most sensitive measuring instruments ever built by the human species. Each detector consists of two arms, each four kilometers long, arranged in an L shape. A laser beam is split and sent down both arms simultaneously, bouncing off mirrors at the far ends, returning to the beam splitter, recombining. If the two arms are exactly the same length, the recombined beams interfere destructively, they cancel each other out, and no light reaches the detector. If a gravitational wave passes through, it stretches one arm and compresses the other, by a tiny amount, by an amount that is smaller than the width of an atom, and the beams no longer cancel perfectly, and a tiny amount of light reaches the detector, and the tiny amount of light is the signal, and the signal is the shadow of a black hole merger that happened 1.3 billion years ago in a galaxy that has no name.

The mirrors at the ends of the arms must be isolated from vibration. Not somewhat isolated. Not mostly isolated. Isolated to a degree that borders on the metaphysical. A truck driving on a highway ten miles away produces vibrations that are larger than the signal LIGO is trying to detect. A wave breaking on the coast of Louisiana produces vibrations that are larger than the signal. The settling of the building, the thermal expansion of the materials, the quantum fluctuations of the mirror surfaces themselves, all of these produce disturbances that dwarf the signal. LIGO must detect a signal that is smaller than the noise, that is buried in the noise, that is a whisper in a hurricane, and it must distinguish the whisper from the hurricane, and it must do this reliably enough that the detection can be confirmed and published and believed.

The engineering required to achieve this is staggering. The mirrors are suspended on four-stage pendulum systems that isolate them from ground vibration. The laser beam is recycled, bouncing back and forth hundreds of times, effectively lengthening the arms from four kilometers to 1,200 kilometers. The entire detector is enclosed in the largest ultra-high vacuum system in the world, the air removed to a pressure lower than that of outer space, because air molecules bouncing off the mirrors would produce vibrations larger than the signal. The system is actively controlled by thousands of sensors and actuators that continuously monitor and correct for environmental disturbances. The whole thing, the entire four-kilometer, billion-dollar, twenty-year-in-development instrument, exists for one purpose: to detect the shadow of invisible objects on the fabric of spacetime.

And it worked. On September 14, 2015, it worked, and the species that started by reading the shadow of a stick on the ground read the shadow of a black hole merger on the fabric of the universe, and the method was the same, and the principle was the same. You cannot observe the thing directly. You observe its shadow. You read the absence. You measure the nothing. And the nothing tells you that something is there.

Most of the universe is shadow.

This is not a metaphor. This is not a poetic restatement of a complex idea. This is the current consensus of observational cosmology, expressed in the most literal terms available. Approximately 27 percent of the mass-energy content of the universe consists of dark matter, a substance that does not emit light, does not absorb light, does not interact with light in any way that any instrument has ever detected. Approximately 68 percent consists of dark energy, a phenomenon that is driving the accelerating expansion of the universe and that is even less understood than dark matter, so poorly understood that calling it "dark energy" is essentially a placeholder, a label for a phenomenon that has been observed but not explained. Approximately 5 percent, the remaining fraction, is ordinary matter, the matter that makes up stars and planets and people and telescopes and everything that the human species has ever seen or touched or measured directly.

Five percent. The visible universe, the universe of stars and galaxies and nebulae and planets and moons, the universe that astronomy has spent four hundred years mapping with telescopes of increasing power and precision, the universe that fills the images from the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, the universe that looks, when you see these images, infinite and overwhelming and more than enough, this universe is five percent of what is there. The other 95 percent is dark. The other 95 percent is shadow.

Dark matter was first inferred in the 1930s by Fritz Zwicky, a Swiss-American astronomer working at Caltech, a man whose brilliance was matched by his abrasiveness, who called his colleagues spherical bastards because, he said, they were bastards no matter which direction you looked at them. Zwicky was studying the Coma Cluster, a massive cluster of galaxies roughly 320 million light-years from Earth, and he noticed that the galaxies in the cluster were moving too fast. They were orbiting the center of the cluster at velocities that, given the visible mass of the cluster, should have flung them apart. The cluster should not have been bound. The gravitational attraction of the visible matter was not enough to hold the galaxies in their orbits. The galaxies should have been escaping, flying off into the void, the cluster dissolving like a handful of sand thrown into the wind.

The cluster was not dissolving. The cluster was bound. The galaxies were held. Something was holding them. Something with mass, something with gravitational pull, something that was exerting the force required to keep the galaxies in their orbits. But the something was not visible. The something was not emitting light. The something was not showing up in any telescope at any wavelength. The something was there, exerting gravitational force, shaping the orbits of entire galaxies, and the something was invisible.

Zwicky called it dunkle Materie. Dark matter. The name stuck. The name was shadow. The name said: there is mass here, there is substance here, there is something here that has gravitational reality, and we cannot see it. We can only see its effects. We can only see what it does to the things we can see. We can only infer the dark from its shadow on the light.

Zwicky's observation was largely ignored for decades. The idea that most of the mass in a galaxy cluster was invisible seemed, to many astronomers, either absurd or an indication that something was wrong with the measurements. It was easier to believe that Zwicky had made an error than to believe that most of the universe was dark. The light was there. The galaxies were there. Surely the light accounted for the mass. Surely what you could see was what there was.

In the 1970s, Vera Rubin and Kent Ford made the idea impossible to ignore. Rubin and Ford were measuring the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, plotting the orbital velocity of stars and gas clouds at different distances from the galactic center. The expectation, based on the visible mass distribution, was that the orbital velocity would decrease with distance from the center, the way the orbital velocity of planets in the solar system decreases with distance from the sun. Mercury orbits faster than Venus. Venus orbits faster than Earth. Neptune orbits much slower than Mercury. This is because the sun's gravitational pull weakens with distance, and the orbital velocity is determined by the gravitational pull, and the gravitational pull is determined by the mass, and the mass is concentrated at the center, and therefore the further you are from the center, the less gravitational pull, the slower the orbit.

The galaxies did not cooperate. The rotation curves were flat. The orbital velocity did not decrease with distance from the center. Stars and gas clouds at the outer edges of galaxies were orbiting just as fast as stars and gas clouds near the center. This was impossible under the assumption that the visible matter was all the matter there was. If the visible matter was all the matter, the outer stars should have been orbiting more slowly. They were not. They were orbiting at the same speed, which meant there was mass out there, at the edges, in the outer reaches of the galaxies, mass that was exerting gravitational pull, mass that was keeping the outer stars in their orbits, and the mass was not visible. The mass was dark. The mass was shadow.

Rubin's rotation curves were the confirmation that Zwicky had been right and that the problem was not measurement error but reality. The universe contained far more matter than could be seen. The visible matter, the matter that emitted or absorbed or reflected light, the matter that the entire edifice of observational astronomy was built to detect, was a minority. The majority was dark. The majority was invisible. The majority was known only by its gravitational effects on the visible minority, the way a person in a dark room is known only by the things they bump into.

Forty years of subsequent observation have confirmed and refined this picture. Dark matter has been mapped. Not directly, because it cannot be seen directly, but through its gravitational effects, through the way it bends light from distant sources, through the way it shapes the distribution of galaxies, through the way it influences the pattern of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The maps show a vast web, a cosmic scaffolding, a network of filaments and nodes and voids, the dark matter forming the structure on which the visible universe is arranged, the galaxies clustered along the filaments, the voids between the filaments empty, the whole thing resembling a sponge or a neural network or the structure of bone, and the structure is mostly dark, the visible galaxies strung along the dark filaments like lights along a wire, like decorations on a scaffolding, like the luminous minority arranged on the invisible majority.

The universe is a shadow that contains a few points of light. We live in the points of light. We see the points of light. We study the points of light with telescopes and spectrographs and radio dishes and space probes. And the points of light are five percent of what is there. The rest is shadow. The rest is the dark shape on which the light is arranged. The rest is the absence that gives the presence its structure. The rest is the thing we cannot see that determines the shape of everything we can see.

This is not a metaphor. It is not a rhetorical flourish deployed to connect cosmology to the essay's theme. It is the observed structure of the universe. The dark matter is there. The dark energy is there. They are the dominant components of reality. They are the 95 percent. And they are known to us only through their shadows, only through their effects on the visible, only through the way the light bends and the galaxies move and the expansion accelerates and the 5 percent that we can see is shaped and structured and governed by the 95 percent that we cannot.

The shadow is where the mass is. This was true in Eratosthenes' measurement and it is true in LIGO's detection and it is true in Rubin's rotation curves and it is true in the large-scale structure of the universe. The shadow is where the information is. The shadow is where the structure is. The shadow is where the majority of everything is, and the lit part, the visible part, the part we see and name and study and celebrate, is the minority. The light is the exception. The shadow is the rule.

The cosmic microwave background radiation is the shadow of the Big Bang.

This requires some unpacking. The CMB, as it is known, is a faint glow of microwave radiation that fills the entire sky, uniform in every direction to a precision of one part in a hundred thousand, the most perfect blackbody spectrum ever measured, corresponding to a temperature of 2.725 Kelvin, which is 2.725 degrees above absolute zero, which is very cold, which is the temperature of the universe itself, the temperature that the universe has cooled to after 13.8 billion years of expansion.

The CMB was produced approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang, at a moment called recombination. Before recombination, the universe was a plasma, a dense, hot, opaque fog of protons and electrons and photons, the photons scattering off the free electrons continuously, the photons unable to travel any significant distance without being deflected, the universe opaque the way fog is opaque, not because the material was solid but because the light could not get through, could not travel in a straight line, could not carry information from one place to another without being scattered and scrambled and randomized.

At 380,000 years, the universe had cooled enough for the electrons to combine with the protons to form hydrogen atoms. The free electrons disappeared. The scattering stopped. The photons were released, suddenly, all at once, everywhere, the fog clearing, the universe becoming transparent, the light free to travel in straight lines for the first time. The photons that were released at that moment have been traveling ever since. They have been traveling for 13.8 billion years. They have been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, their wavelengths stretched from the visible light they were at the moment of release to the microwaves they are now, the expansion of the universe stretching them by a factor of roughly 1,100. They arrive at the earth from every direction, the faint afterglow of the moment the universe became transparent, the fossil light of the first clearing, the oldest light in the universe.

The CMB is a shadow in the sense that it is a record of an absence. It is the record of the moment when the opacity ended, when the scattering stopped, when the fog cleared. It is a photograph of the universe at 380,000 years old, taken not by any camera but by the universe itself, the light released at the moment of clearing preserving the state of the universe at that moment the way a photograph preserves the state of a scene at the moment the shutter clicks. The CMB is the universe's baby picture, and the baby picture is a shadow, is a record of where matter was dense and where it was sparse, where the temperature was slightly higher and where it was slightly lower, the tiny fluctuations, the one-part-in-a-hundred-thousand variations, that would eventually grow into the galaxies and galaxy clusters and vast cosmic structures that we see today.

The hot spots in the CMB correspond to regions that were slightly denser than average, regions where matter was slightly more concentrated, regions where gravity would eventually win, pulling more matter in, the dense regions growing denser, the sparse regions growing sparser, the tiny primordial fluctuations amplified by gravity over billions of years into the galaxies and clusters and filaments that constitute the large-scale structure of the universe. The CMB is the shadow of the universe's infancy. The galaxies are the things that grew from the shadow.

The shadows on the moon are absolute.

On the earth, a shadow is never fully dark. The atmosphere scatters light. The sky is blue because the atmosphere scatters blue light in every direction, filling the sky with diffuse illumination, and this diffuse illumination leaks into shadows, softening them, filling them with faint light, ensuring that even the deepest shadow on earth contains some illumination. A shadow on earth is not the absence of light. It is the reduction of light. The penumbra extends everywhere.

The moon has no atmosphere. The moon has no sky. Above the lunar surface there is nothing, vacuum, the void of space, black and absolute. There is no scattering. There is no diffuse illumination. There is no penumbral softening. When an object on the lunar surface blocks the sun's light, the shadow behind it is as dark as the object is opaque. The shadow is total. The shadow is the absence of light in the most literal sense possible, the absence of every photon, the absence of any illumination whatsoever.

The Apollo astronauts discovered this, and the discovery was viscerally disorienting. The shadows on the lunar surface were black. Not dark gray, not deep shadow, not the darkest shadow they had ever seen. Black. The absolute black of the void of space, because the shadow on the moon is the void of space, is a region where no scattered light arrives, where the only illumination is the faint reflected light from nearby sunlit surfaces, and that reflected light is so dim compared to the direct sunlight that the shadow appears, to the human eye, as black as the space above.

The astronauts had difficulty working in the shadows. They could not see. They would step from brilliant, unfiltered sunlight into shadow and the shadow was a wall of blackness, instantaneous, without transition, without the gradual dimming that an atmosphere provides. One step in the sun and the next step in the dark. The transition was binary in a way that earth shadows never are. The penumbra, the gradient, the slow fade from light to dark that every shadow on earth has, did not exist. The shadows on the moon had edges. Real edges. Hard edges. The kind of edges that the human eye, evolved under an atmosphere that softens every transition, was not prepared for.

Tools dropped in shadow were lost. You could not see them. You could reach into the shadow and feel for them, but you could not see them, because there was no light in the shadow, none at all, and the human eye, no matter how well adapted to darkness, requires some photons, some illumination, some scattered light, and the lunar shadow provided none. The astronauts learned to avoid dropping things in shadow. They learned to plan their movements around the shadows. They learned that the shadow on the moon was not the familiar, soft, penumbral, atmosphere-mediated shadow of earth but something else, something more fundamental, something closer to the true definition of shadow, which is: the region where light is not.

Earth shadows are compromises. Earth shadows are negotiations between light and atmosphere, between the source and the medium, between the direct illumination and the scattered illumination that fills the sky. Every shadow on earth is softened by the atmosphere. Every shadow on earth is a penumbral shadow, a partial shadow, a shadow that contains some light. We have never, on this planet, experienced a true shadow. The closest we come is a total eclipse, when the moon's shadow blocks the direct sunlight and the sky darkens and the light changes and the world feels wrong, but even then the atmosphere scatters light from beyond the shadow's edge and the darkness is not total, is not absolute, is not the black void of a lunar shadow.

The shadows on the moon are what shadows actually are, stripped of atmosphere, stripped of scattering, stripped of every mediating influence that makes earth shadows tolerable. They are the pure phenomenon. They are shadow in its essential form. And the essential form is absolute darkness.

The Polynesian navigators read the shadows of islands in the ocean.

This is not a metaphor. The islands of the Pacific Ocean are small and scattered across an enormity of water. Thousands of islands spread across millions of square kilometers of open ocean. The navigators of Polynesia, the people who colonized these islands over the course of centuries, sailing in double-hulled canoes across thousands of miles of open water without compass, without sextant, without any instrument more sophisticated than the human body and the trained human mind, these navigators found the islands by reading the ocean the way Eratosthenes read the ground.

An island in the open ocean disturbs the pattern of ocean swells. The swells, the long rolling waves that are generated by distant storms and that propagate across the ocean surface in regular, predictable patterns, interact with the island. The island blocks the swells. The island creates a shadow in the swell pattern, a region downwind and down-swell of the island where the wave pattern is disrupted, where the regular rhythm of the swells is broken, where the water behaves differently from the open ocean around it.

The navigators could feel this. They could feel the change in the motion of the canoe as it entered the island's wave shadow. The canoe would move differently. The rhythm of the rocking would change. The pattern of the waves hitting the hull would shift, the timing altered, the amplitude reduced or redirected, and the navigator, lying on the deck of the canoe, feeling the motion of the water through the hull, could detect these changes, could interpret them, could determine from the pattern of disturbance the direction and the approximate distance of an island that was still below the horizon, still invisible, still too far away to see.

The island was hidden. The island was over the horizon. The island was inaccessible to direct observation. But the island cast a shadow in the ocean, a wave shadow, a disturbance in the pattern of the sea, and the navigator read the shadow and found the island. The method is Eratosthenes' method. The method is the gnomon's method. The method is the oldest method: you cannot see the thing directly, so you read its shadow. You read the absence. You read the disturbance in the pattern. You infer the thing from the mark it makes on the medium around it.

The Polynesian navigators colonized the Pacific this way. They found Hawaii this way. They found New Zealand this way. They found Easter Island, one of the most remote inhabited places on earth, 2,200 miles from the nearest populated land, a speck of volcanic rock in the middle of the largest ocean on the planet, and they found it by reading the ocean's shadows, by feeling the wave patterns change, by interpreting the disturbance that a small island creates in the vast regularity of the open sea.

The method has been studied by Western oceanographers and navigation researchers, and the studies confirm that the wave shadow of an island is real, is detectable, is physically measurable by instruments. The disturbance extends for miles downwind and down-swell of the island. The pattern is consistent and predictable. The navigators were not guessing. They were reading. They were reading a shadow that was cast not by light on a surface but by land on water, not by opacity blocking photons but by mass blocking waves, and the reading was accurate, and the reading led them to islands that they could not see, and the reading populated the Pacific.

The shadow is where the information is. This has been true at every scale we have examined.

At the scale of a stick in the ground, the shadow told Eratosthenes the size of the earth. At the scale of a human body, the shadow on the bank steps in Hiroshima told us that a person was there. At the scale of an institution, the shadow banking system told us where the risk was. At the scale of a planet, the moon's shadow during an eclipse told Eddington that spacetime was curved. At the scale of a galaxy, the flat rotation curve told Rubin that most of the mass was dark. At the scale of the universe, the cosmic microwave background told us the shape of the infant cosmos.

At every scale, the same method. You cannot observe the thing directly. You observe its shadow. You read the absence. You measure the nothing. And the nothing tells you what the something is.

The shadow is not the absence of information. The shadow is the carrier of information. The shadow is the medium through which the inaccessible becomes accessible, the invisible becomes visible, the unreachable becomes measurable. The shadow is how we know the things we cannot see. The shadow is how we have always known the things we cannot see.
