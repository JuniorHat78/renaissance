Renaissance Plan
Date: 2026-02-17
Status: Approved roadmap only. Implementation paused.

Product Direction
- Renaissance is the publication/archive index.
- Etching God into Sand is one essay entry in the archive.
- Sections are currently unnamed and ordered (I..X).

Primary Goal
- Move from chapter-first IA to essay-first IA without losing current reading quality.

Phase Plan
1. Information Architecture
- Home page becomes essay index.
- Essay page becomes the landing page for one essay.
- Section page remains long-form reader for a single section.

2. Data Model
- Add essay registry metadata (all essays).
- Add per-essay metadata (title, slug, summary, section order, source directory).
- Keep section text files as canonical source.

3. Routing and Navigation
- Home route: index of essays.
- Essay route: one essay overview + section TOC + search.
- Section route: section reader with Home + Back to Essay + Prev/Next.

4. Search Behavior Revision
- Search scope defaults to current essay.
- One result row per occurrence (not one per section/chapter).
- Sort order is reading order: section order, then in-text occurrence order.
- Result summary includes total hits and per-section counts.

5. Labeling Strategy
- Keep section labels generic for now (Section I, Section II, ...).
- Add optional metadata hook for custom section names later.

6. Runtime Compatibility
- Continue supporting both localhost server mode and file mode fallback.
- Preserve encoding-safe text rendering.

7. QA and Acceptance
- Validate home index, essay page, section page, and navigation.
- Validate search ordering, per-occurrence rendering, and counts.
- Validate behavior in both http:// and file:// modes.

Out of Scope (Current Phase)
- Cross-essay global search.
- Authoring UI for naming sections.
- Scrollytelling/animation-heavy narrative effects.

Deliverables
- Updated page structure and routing.
- Essay metadata files.
- Search engine updates for per-occurrence ordered hits.
- Regression coverage for runtime modes and encoding.
